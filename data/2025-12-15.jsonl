In this paper, we generalize this result to arbitrary genus. Our approach employs the Lauricella system of type D for hypergeometric series in $2g-1$ variables, whose truncations (up to scalar multiplication) give the entries of a Cartier-Manin matrix. The multiplicity-one theorem is obtained through an analysis of equalities involving partial derivatives of these entries."}

For an ideal $I \\subset \\mathcal{E}(Ω)$, we denote by $Z(I)$ its zero set. A classical result of René Thom asserts that if $I$ is a finitely generated Łojasiewicz ideal, then $Z(I)$ contains an open dense subset of smooth points. The goal of this note is to examine a converse question: does the existence of an open dense set of smooth points in $Z(I)$ ( $I\\subset\\mathcal{E}(Ω) $ is a finitely generated ideal) imply that the ideal $I$ is Łojasiewicz? We analyze obstructions to such a converse and identify geometric conditions under which it fails.\n  As an application, we study smooth real-valued functions of two variables whose zero set coincides with the classical Hawaiian earring, the union of infinitely many tangent circles accumulating at the origin. We show that any such function must be flat at the origin, in the sense that all partial derivatives vanish there. We formulate a geometric criterion concerning families of smooth arcs tangent at a point with unbounded or infinitely varying curvature, and derive from it a degenerate form of the Łojasiewicz inequality adapted to this non-analytic setting."}

We define a smooth ambient space, which we call the non-associative Hilbert scheme, containing the classical nested Hilbert scheme $\\mathrm{NHilb}^{\\underline{d}}(\\mathbb{A}^n)$ as the associativity, cut out by an explicit section of an associativity bundle. This construction yields canonical perfect obstruction theories and virtual fundamental classes on $\\mathrm{NHilb}^{\\underline{d}}(\\mathbb{A}^n)$ for all $(n,\\underline d)$. Using virtual localization, we obtain closed formulas for these virtual classes as sums over admissible nested partitions. Over the punctual locus, we rewrite these as a single multivariable iterated residue formula governing all virtual integrals. Our construction works for all $n$, produces positive-dimensional virtual classes when $n$ is large compared to the number of points, and we expect that they extend the non-commutative matrix model and virtual class construction on Calabi-Yau threefolds."}

More precisely, we generalize a local version of this transform, due to Shiho, and a topos-theoretic version, due to Oyama. Let $k$ be a perfect field of positive characteristic $p$ and equip $S=\\operatorname{Spec}k$ with the trivial log structure. For a log smooth scheme $X$ over $S,$ we obtain, under the assumption that the exact relative Frobenius lifts to the Witt vectors, a fully faithful functor from the category of quasi-coherent modules on the base change $X'=X\\times_{S,F_S}S$ of $X$ by the Frobenius $F_S$ of $S,$ equipped with a quasi-nilpotent Higgs field, to the category of quasi-coherent modules on $X$ equipped with a quasi-nilpotent integrable connection. In another direction, we construct crystalline-like topoi and subcategories of crystals $\\mathcal{C}'$ and $\\underline{\\mathcal{C}},$ equivalent respectively to modules with Higgs fields and integrable connections, and a fully faithful functor $\\mathcal{C}' \\rightarrow \\underline{\\mathcal{C}}.$ Since the Frobenius morphism is not, in general, flat in the log smooth setting, it is not clear that these functors are essentially surjective. To address this issue, we refine the topoi and crystals mentioned above by endowing them with an indexed structure, inspired by Lorenzon's extension of Cartier descent to smooth logarithmic schemes. Using the Azumaya property of the ring of logarithmic differential operators, we then obtain an equivalence between the corresponding categories of indexed crystals, thereby generalizing the Cartier transform."}
