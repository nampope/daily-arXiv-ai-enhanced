Namely, we apply the symplectic JSJ decomposition to a contact\nsurgery diagram for some $(Y,\\zeta)$, producing a finite collection of contact\nmanifolds, also described diagrammatically, whose exact/weak symplectic\nfillings determine those of $(Y,\\zeta)$. We apply this technique to recover\nknown symplectic filling classifications for certain lens spaces and torus\nbundles, and also to provide an algorithm for classifying the exact/weak\nsymplectic fillings of a large class of plumbed 3-manifolds."}

This work\ninvestigates two distinct regimes: discrete subgroups of the Lorentz group\n$O(n,1)$ acting on $\\mathbb{R}^{n,1}$, and cocompact actions of discrete groups\non $\\mathbb{R}^n$. We prove that for discrete Lorentz groups, the ring of\npolynomial invariants remains finitely generated, yet the classical Schwarz\nTheorem, stating that smooth invariants are generated by polynomial ones,\nfails. Conversely, for cocompact actions, the polynomial invariant ring\ncollapses to constants, but a persistent structure of smooth invariants\npersists and is finitely generated over the smooth functions on the quotient.\nThese results reveal a fourfold classification of invariant-theoretic regimes,\nextending the classical framework and delineating the boundaries of the\nHilbert-Weyl and Schwarz theorems."}

The\ncriterion is formulated in terms of an explicitly computable sequence of\nintegers, called the splitting-order sequence. Our main theorem shows that if\nall entries of the sequence are at most $p-1$, then the hypersurface is\nperfectoid pure, and the perfectoid-pure threshold can be computed explicitly\nfrom it. As a consequence, we prove that for any regular local ring $R$, the\nperfectoid pure threshold $\\mathrm{ppt}(R,p)$ with respect to $p$ is always a\nrational number. Moreover, we show that for sufficiently large primes $p$, the\ncone over a Fermat type Calabi-Yau hypersurface is perfectoid pure, revealing\nnew and unexpected examples of perfectoid pure singularities."}
