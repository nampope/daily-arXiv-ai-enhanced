As a corollary, the\nsurface-knot obtained from the anti-parallel surface-link of a non-ribbon\nsurface-knot by surgery along a nontrivial fusion 1-handle is a non-ribbon\nsurface-knot. This result answers Cochran's conjecture on non-ribbon\nsphere-knots in the affirmative."}

In recent times, the focus has shifted to identify tractable cases\nbeyond the fully Hodge-Newton decomposable ones, and several instances have\nbeen identified where only products of classical Deligne-Lusztig varities with\nsimpler spaces occur.\n  In our paper, we provide a uniform framework to capture these phenomena. By\nstudying liftings from the affine flag variety to the loop group and combining\nthem with the Deligne-Lusztig reduction method, our main result is a powerful\ncriterion to show that an affine Deligne-Lusztig variety is the product of a\nclassical Deligne-Lusztig variety with affine spaces and pointed affine spaces.\n  We introduce the class of elements that we call having geometric Coxeter\ntype, strictly including previously studied notions such as positive Coxeter\ntype or finite Coxeter type. These elements of geometric Coxeter type satisfy\nthe conditions for our main result and also a condition on the Newton\nstratification introduced by Mili\\'cevi\\'c-Viehmann."}

For\na broad class of complexity-one G-varieties, we show that this group is\nrepresentable by a group scheme locally of finite type when the base field has\ncharacteristic zero. We also establish representability, by a linear group, in\nthe case of almost homogeneous G-varieties of arbitrary complexity. Using an\nexact sequence description of the equivariant automorphism group, we derive a\ncriterion to determine whether a complexity-one variety admits only finitely\nmany real forms.
