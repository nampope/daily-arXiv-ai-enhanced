This is a physical model of a folded ribbon knot in the plane, first\nintroduced by Louis Kauffman. We study the folded ribbonlength of these folded\nribbon knots, which is defined as the knot's length-to-width ratio. The {\\em\nribbonlength problem} asks to find the infimal folded ribbonlength of a knot or\nlink type. By finding new methods of creating folded ribbon knots, we improve\nupon existing upper bounds for the folded ribbonlength of $(2,q)$-torus links,\ntwist knots, and pretzel links. These give the best known bounds to date for\nsmall crossing knots in these families. For example, there is a folded\nribbonlength twist knot $T_n$ with folded ribbonlength $\\text{Rib}(T_n) = n\n+6$. Applying this to the figure-eight knot $T_2$ yields a folded ribbonlength\n$\\text{Rib}(T_2)= 8$, which we conjecture is the infimum."}

The families $\\mathbb{P}^4,Q^4,W_5$ are\nunique up to isomorphism and have a semi-free $\\mathbb{C}^*$-action.\n  This is mostly proved by an analysis of closed symplectic $8$-manifolds with\n$b_{2}(M)=1$ with a semi-free Hamiltonian $S^1$-action using methods of\nequivariant symplectic geometry. In this setting some notable restrictions are\nobtained: the index is greater than $1$, $b_{4}(M)$ is bounded above and all\nfixed components are shown to be symplectomorphic to products of projective\nspaces. The proof of the main result appeals in the last step to the\nclassification of prime Fano $4$-folds with index greater than $1$."}

In particular, we\nshow that the conclusion holds for spherical varieties. We then show a version\nfor singular varieties, e.g. discriminant varieties, where in general we only\nrecover a part of equivariant cohomology ring, generated by Chern classes. We\nalso show that an analogous result, connecting equivariant K-theory to the ring\nof functions on the fixed-point scheme, holds for GKM spaces.\n  This is a concise version of some results from the PhD thesis\narXiv:2407.14659, which contains a broader introduction to the topic."}
