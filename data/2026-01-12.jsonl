Our primary result is a structural factorization of the transition matrix $C$ between the Mirković--Vilonen (MV) basis and the convolution basis into $C = P \\cdot M \\cdot A \\cdot Q^{-1}$, where the four factors represent: equivariant localization ($Q$), fusion via nearby cycles ($A$), local intersection cohomology stalks ($M$), and diagonal normalization ($P$). Utilizing this factorization, and by introducing the Geometric Efficiency metric ($η$) we establish a Universal Geometric Rank Bound, proving that the rank of the transition matrix $C$ is bounded by the dimension of the local Braden--MacPherson (BMP) stalks."}

Every four-manifold can be represented in terms of a link, by a Kirby diagram. This point of view has led to progress in computing invariants of smooth four-manifolds that can detect exotic structures. We explain how this was done in two contexts: Heegaard Floer theory and skein lasagna modules. We also describe a program to understand four-manifolds through the properties of knots on their boundaries."}

The key technical input is the calculation of the Brauer group of $BG$, for $G$ a smooth connected semisimple linear algebraic group."}

We deduce that many reductive homogeneous spaces do not admit compact quotients, such as the complex spheres $\\mathrm{O}(n+1,\\mathbb{C})/\\mathrm{O}(n,\\mathbb{C})$ for all $n \\notin \\{1,3,7\\}$, or $\\mathrm{SL}(n,\\mathbb{R})/\\mathrm{SL}(m,\\mathbb{R})$ for all $n>m>1$, which solves conjectures of T.

We construct an intrinsic three-term deformation complex on $X$ whose fibers encode transverse first-order classes and primary obstructions, and whose cohomology agrees on the operadic loci with the standard low-degree deformation cohomology (à la Gerstenhaber and Nijenhuis--Richardson). We then define a canonical quadratic map $κ^{inc}_{2,μ}\\colon H^2_{inc}(μ)\\to H^3_{inc}(μ)$ that controls second-order lifts modulo isotriviality. If $μ$ is smooth point in a reduced component and $(κ^{inc}_{2,μ})^{-1}(0)=\\{0\\}$, then the $G$-orbit of $μ$ is Zariski open in that component.

We give several applications, including to spaces of holomorphic forms on toroidal compactifications and to the cohomology of the interior. In particular, we give a complete characterization of when the cohomology of $X_{g,s}$, or one of its toroidal compactifications, is of Tate type. The result is independent of the choice of toroidal compactification."}

The idea is to work with models in $\\mathbb{P}^8$ induced by a symmetric level-$3$ theta structure. In this setting, the action of three-torsion points is linear, and the isogeny formulas can be described in a simple way as the composition of easy-to-evaluate maps. In the description of these formulas, the relation with the Burkhardt quartic threefold plays an important role. Furthermore, we discuss generalizations of the idea to higher dimensions as well as different isogeny degrees."}
