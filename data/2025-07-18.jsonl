This leads to a new rigidity result for closed\nhyperbolic surfaces -- distinct from the $9g-9$ theorem and length spectrum\nrigidity -- knowing only for any two disjoint simple closed curves which one is\nlonger (in terms of hyperbolic or extremal length) suffices to determine the\nhyperbolic metric on the surface.

Comments very welcome!", "summary": "In this paper, we study the vertex functions of finite type $A$ bow\nvarieties. Vertex functions are $K$-theoretic analogs of $I$-functions, and 3d\nmirror symmetry predicts that the $q$-difference equations satisfied by the\nvertex functions of a variety and its 3d mirror dual are the same after a\nchange of variable swapping the roles of the various parameters. Thus the\nvertex functions are related by a matrix of elliptic functions, which is\nexpected to be the elliptic stable envelope of M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We\nprove all of these statements.\n  The strategy of our proof is to reduce to the case of cotangent bundles of\ncomplete flag varieties, for which the $q$-difference equations can be\nexplicitly identified with Macdonald difference equations. A key ingredient in\nthis reduction, of independent interest, involves relating vertex functions of\nthe cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with those of a ``finer\" flag\nvariety. Our formula involves specializing certain K\\\"ahler parameters (also\ncalled Novikov parameters) to singularities of the vertex functions.
