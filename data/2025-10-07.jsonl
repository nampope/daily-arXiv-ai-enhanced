Nevertheless, Cannon\nand Thurston showed that there is a map from the circle at infinity of the\nhyperbolic plane to the 2-sphere at infinity of hyperbolic 3-space. The\nCannon-Thurston map is surjective, finite-to-one, and gives a space-filling\ncurve. Here we prove that many natural measures on the circle when pushed\nforward by the Cannon-Thurston map become singular with respect to many natural\nmeasures on the 2-sphere. The circle measures we consider are the Lebesgue\nmeasure and stationary measures that arise from fully supported random walks on\nthe surface group. Whereas the measures on the sphere we consider are the\nLebesgue measure and stationary measures that arise from geometric random walks\non the 3-manifold group. The singularity of measures is ultimately derived from\nthe following geometric result. We prove that a hyperbolic geodesic sampled\nwith respect to a pushforward measure asymptotically spends a definite\nproportion of its time close to a fiber. On the other hand, we show that a\nhyperbolic geodesic sampled with respect to a natural measure on the sphere\nspends an asymptotically negligible proportion of its time close to a fiber.\nFor a more restricted class of measures, namely the Lebesgue measure and\nstationary measures from geometric random walks on the surface group, we also\nprove an effective result for the proportion of time spent close to a fiber.
