Examples include (a) smooth\nvarieties with finite Albanese map, (b) normalizations of subvarieties of\nhermitian locally symmetric varieties of noncompact type, and (c) higher\ndimensional Kodaira fibrations. We conjecture that Koll\\'ar-hyperbolic\nvarieties satisfy a vanishing theorem, which says roughly that if $P$ is\nperverse sheaf underlying a mixed Hodge module on such a variety then the limit\nof normalized dimensions of the cohomology groups of $P$ are zero in nonzero\ndegrees, where the limit is taken over a suitable tower of \\'etale covers. We\ncall such varieties V-hyperbolic. V-hyperbolic varieties satisfy a Gromov type\nvanishing theorem for $L^2$ cohomology, the inequalities $(-1)^d\\chi(X) \\ge 0$\nand $(-1)^{d-p}\\chi(\\Omega_X^p)\\ge 0$ in the smooth case, and more generally,\nan inequality for mixed Hodge modules conjectured under related assumptions by\nMaxim, Wang and the author.

The main contribution of this paper is to deal with\nthis type of surfaces. Namely, we study the interaction strength of the regular\n$n-$gons for $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$ and the Bouw-M\\\"oller surfaces $S_{m,n}$ with\n$1 < \\gcd(m,n) < n$. This answers a conjecture of the author from (Boulanger,\nAlgebraic intersection, lengths and Veech surfaces, arXiv:2309.17165). and it\ncompletes the study of the algebraic interaction strength KVol on the regular\npolygon Veech surfaces. Our results on Bouw-M\\\"oller surfaces extends the\nresults of (Boulanger-Pasquinelli, Algebraic intersections on Bouw-M\\\"oller\nsurfaces, and more general convex polygons, arXiv:2409.01711).
