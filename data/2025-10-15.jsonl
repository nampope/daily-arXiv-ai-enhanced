We present several applications, including existence and uniqueness\nresults for Veronese surfaces satisfying conditions to pass through given\npoints or curves.

In this article, we study rank two\npolyptych lattices with a single mutation. We prove that the associated\nprojective surface $X$ is a $\\mathbb{G}_m$-surface that admits an equivariant\n$1$-complement $B\\in |-K_X|$ such that $B$ supports an effective ample divisor.\nConversely, we show that a $\\mathbb{G}_m$-surface $X$ that admits an\nequivariant $1$-complement $B\\in |-K_X|$ supporting an effective ample divisor\ncomes from a polyptych lattice polytope. Finally, we compute the complexity of\nthe pair $(X,B)$ in terms of the data of the polyptych lattice, we describe the\nCox ring of $X$, and study its toric degenerations."}
