Namely, for $d > 2$, every $\\varepsilon > 0$, every $x \\in \\St_\\varepsilon$, and every choice of $ρ\\in (0,1)$, we have\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\H(\\St_\\varepsilon \\cap B_{ρ\\varepsilon}(x))}{\\varepsilon} \\leq \\left ( \\frac{64d}{1-ρ} \\right) ^{d-2}.\n  \\]\n  As a corollary, we obtain a density-type result, i.e. that the set $\\St_\\varepsilon \\cap B_{ρ\\varepsilon}(x)$ consists of at most\n  \\[\n  \\left ( \\frac{64d}{1-ρ} \\right) ^{d-1}\n  \\]\n  line segments.\n  In the plane (i.e., for $d=2$), it is possible to obtain tight structural results."}

The infimal size of such a set is called the metric geodesic cover number of $X$. We prove reductions enabling us to find, with computer assistance, optimal geodesic covers of a graph and use these to determine the cover number of several standard graphs, including $K_4$, $K_5$ and $K_{3,3}$. We also give a catalogue of topological spaces with cover number $3$, and use it to deduce that any such space must be planar."}

For a special alternating diagram, the Laplacian encodes both the combinatorics of the checkerboard graph and the crossing signs. While its spectrum depends on the chosen diagram, we show that a specific quadratic trace expression involving the Laplacian and its Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse is invariant under flype moves. The invariant admits an interpretation in terms of total effective resistance of the associated weighted graph viewed as an electrical network. Explicit computations for pairs of flype-related diagrams demonstrate that, although the Laplacian characteristic polynomials differ, the invariant FP coincides. Values for several prime alternating knots are provided."}
