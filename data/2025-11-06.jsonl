We also\nobserve that every smooth complete toric variety of Picard rank two is\nadditive. We apply our methods to the class of smooth Fano toric varieties and\nnotably determine all such varieties of dimension up to 6 admitting an additive\naction."}

We relate\nthe generalized version to the Hodge filtration on local cohomology, depth of\nDu Bois complexes, Hodge-Lyubeznik numbers and prove a striking inequality on\nthe codimension of the non-perverse locus of the shifted constant sheaf.\n  We study the case of cones over projective rational homology manifolds. We\nstudy when such varieties satisfy the weakened condition mentioned above as\nwell as the partial Poincar\\'{e} duality. To do this, we completely describe\ntheir higher local cohomology modules in terms of the Hodge theory of the\ncorresponding projective variety. We apply this to the study of Hodge-Lyubeznik\nnumbers and the intersection cohomology."}
