We say that an embedded surface $\\Sigma \\subset X$ is Real\nif $\\sigma$ maps $\\Sigma$ to itself orientation reversingly. We prove that a\ncohomology class $u \\in H^2(X ; \\mathbb{Z})$ can be represented by a Real\nembedded surface if and only if $u$ can be lifted to a class in equivariant\ncohomology $H^2_{\\mathbb{Z}_2}(X ; \\mathbb{Z}_-)$. We prove that if the Real\nSeiberg--Witten invariants of $X$ are non-zero then the genus of Real embedded\nsurfaces in $X$ satisfy an adjunction inequality. We prove two versions of the\nadjunction inequality, one for non-negative self-intersection and one for\narbitrary self-intersection. We show with examples that the minimal genus of\nReal embedded surfaces can be larger than the minimal genus of arbitrary\nembedded surfaces."}
