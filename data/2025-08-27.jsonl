Our\nground field must be characteristic 0 because of the use we make of Bertini\ntheorems. The steps we take are, first, defining and studying an \"open\" version\nof Chow zero. Second, we use this to translate our study to that of a Chow\ngroup of $G$ Galois extensions. We prove a \"Sylow\" property and thereby yield a\nconnection between the invariants of $G$ and that of its Sylow subgroups. In\nparticular, we show that if $G$ is a finite group with $p$ Sylow subgroup $P$,\n$V$ is a faithful $G$ module, and $F(V)^P$ has nontrivial unramified\ncohomology, then $F(V)^G$ is not retract rational. Finally, we prove Sylow type\ntheorems for decomposition of the diagonal and the centers of generic division\nalgebras."}

Building on\nthe known limitations of the Alexander-Conway polynomial, we compare the\nconnected sum of two Hopf links (which represents all causally unrelated\nsituations) with the first two Allen-Swenberg links (that are the only known\nexamples when this polynomial does not work). For each diagram we report both\nthe quandle counting invariant (total number of colorings) and an enhanced\nversion that records how many distinct colors appear in each coloring. In our\ntests over small finite fields, plain counts often agree across examples, but\nthe enhanced invariant consistently separates the Hopf case from the\nAllen-Swenberg family, and becomes more discriminating as the field grows. A\nsimple transfer step suggests that this effect persists along the whole\nsequence.

The theoretical foundation of\nthis framework is the main algebraic result of this paper (Theorem A): a proof\nthat the algebra of Jacobi diagrams, A_Jac, possesses the structure of a\nhomotopy E3-algebra. This algebraic structure is shown to be a consequence of\n3-dimensional geometry, originating from a \"Tetrahedron Principle\" where the\nfundamental IHX relation is interpreted as an algebraic manifestation of the\ntetrahedron's combinatorial properties. This geometric perspective is used to\nprovide a rigorous proof of the \"Principle of Decomposability\" that underpins\nthe Goussarov-Habiro clasper calculus, thereby supplying a mathematical\njustification for the consistency of this geometric surgery theory. To\nestablish a computational basis, the framework is built from the first\nprinciples of factorization homology, from which a universal surgery formula is\nderived via the excision axiom (Theorem B) independently of any conjectural\nmodels. The utility of this axiomatically-grounded theory is demonstrated by\nconstructing a new observable, the \"H_1-decorated LMO invariant.\" This\ninvariant is defined in accordance with the principles of TQFT, where the\nevaluation of a closed diagram (a numerical invariant) is the trace of the\ncorresponding open diagram (an operator). As the main applied result of this\npaper (Theorem C), it is proven that this invariant distinguishes the lens\nspaces L(156, 5) and L(156, 29), a pair known to be indistinguishable by the\nclassical LMO invariant. This result validates the proposed framework and\nestablishes the LMO Spectrum as a new tool in quantum topology that unifies the\ngeometric intuition of clasper theory with the algebraic rigor of modern\nhomotopy theory."}
