This\nformalization is based on a recent approach of Harder-Narasimhan theory by Chen\nand Jeannin, which reinterprets the theory in order-theoretic terms and avoids\nthe classical dependence on algebraic geometry. As an application, we formalize\nthe uniqueness of coprimary filtration of a finitely generated module over a\nnoetherian ring, and the existence of the Jordan-H\\\"older filtration of a\nsemistable Harder-Narasimhan game.\n  Code available at: https://github.com/YijunYuan/HarderNarasimhan"}

We prove that the monodromy of\nthe log isocrystal attached to a $p$-adic local system is ''rigid'' along\nirreducible components of the special fiber. Then we give several applications.\nFirst, suppose that $X$ has good reduction. We show that if a family of\nsemistable representations is crystalline at one classical point on $X$, then\nit is crystalline everywhere. Second, combining with the $p$-adic monodromy\ntheorem recently studied by the authors and their collaborators, we prove the\nfollowing surprising rigidity result conjectured by Shankar: for any $p$-adic\nlocal system on a smooth projective variety with good reduction, if it is\npotentially crystalline at one classical point, then it is potentially\ncrystalline everywhere. Finally, we show that if a $p$-adic local system on the\ncomplement of a reduced normal crossing divisor on a smooth rigid analytic\nspace is crystalline at all classical points, then it extends uniquely to a\n$p$-adic local system on the entire space. In other words, such a local system\ncannot have geometric monodromy if it has no arithmetic monodromy everywhere on\nthe complement of a reduced normal crossing divisor."}

The two most prominent ones\nare the Newton polygon stratification, based on the isogeny class of the\n$p$-divisible group of an abelian variety, and the Ekedahl-Oort stratification,\ndefined by the isomorphism class of its $p$-torsion group scheme. In general,\nit is not known how the strata of these two intersect. In this paper we study\nintersections of the Ekedahl-Oort and Newton polygon stratification in\ndimension at most $5$. We give an explicit description of the Ekedahl-Oort\nstratification of the supersingular locus $\\mathcal{S}_{5}$, and describe other\n$p$-rank zero intersections of the two stratifications. For intersections of\npositive $p$-rank, we describe all such intersections in dimensions at most\n$5$. Our proofs use Oort's minimality of $p$-divisible groups, as well as\nrelated results of Chai-Oort and Harashita.

We then describe the bifoliated planes\nassociated with two families of Anosov flows which are constructed from\nalgebraic and combinatorial data via gluing procedures. For one of these\nfamilies, we show that all the resulting bifoliated planes are isomorphic. In\ncontrast, for the other family, we show that the defining data can be recovered\nas a topological invariant of the bifoliated plane."}

Our formula for $\\tau$\nrecovers many existing formulas for the behavior of $\\tau$ under satellite\noperators, including for cables.

Another application is a proof that L-space satellite\noperators satisfy a conjecture of Hedden and Pinz\\'on-Caicedo: If $P$ is an\nL-space satellite operator which acts as a group homomorphism on the smooth\nconcordance group, then $P$ is either the zero operator, the identity operator,\nor the orientation reversing operator."}
