Comments and suggestions welcome!", "summary": "We give invariants of pairs $(M,L)$ consisting of a closed connected oriented\nthree-manifold and an (oriented) framed link $L$ embedded in $M$. This\ninvariant generalizes the Kuperberg and Hennings-Kauffman-Radford (HKR)\ninvariants of three-manifolds. We define Heegaard-Link diagrams which represent\nthe pair $(M,L)$ and use the data of an involutory Hopf algebra and a\nrepresentation of the Drinfeld double to construct the invariant. We show that\nif $L$ is the empty link, then the invariant recovers the Kuperberg invariant,\nand if $M$ is the three-sphere and certain particular representation is chosen,\nthen the invariant recovers the HKR invariant. We also show that if the\nrepresentation is the left regular representation of the Drinfeld double, then\nwe recover the Kuperberg invariant of the surgery manifold $M(L)$, contributing\nto a new proof of the relationship between the HKR and Kuperberg invariants in\nthe semisimple setting. To this end, we give a Heegaard diagram for $M(L)$\ncoming from the Heegaard-Link diagram representing the pair $(M,L)$. We also\nintroduce a colored link invariant extending the construction and show it\nrecovers the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev colored link invariant."}

Scheiderer\nproved that, for smooth curves over the real numbers with nonempty real locus,\neach divisor of sufficiently high degree is linearly equivalent to an effective\ntotally real one. The smallest degree N(X) with this property is called the\ntotally real divisor threshold.\n  When the field is non-Archimedean, we obtain a classification of topological\ntypes of smooth curves for which N(X) can be infinite. As a consequence, for\ncurves over the real numbers we prove that N(X) cannot be bounded from above\nonly in terms of the topological type, unless the real locus has many connected\ncomponents. We complement this qualitative result with a quantitative lower\nbound for N(X), depending on metric properties of the Jacobian and the curve in\nthe Bergman metric.
