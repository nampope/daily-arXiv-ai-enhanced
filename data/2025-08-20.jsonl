Revised version of PhD thesis (2024)", "summary": "This work serves as an opening and basis of an ongoing program investigating\ntopological and geometric aspects of the moduli space of smooth fiberings on a\nmanifold. The present paper focuses on the algebraic and differential topology\nof this space, and particularly addresses the following three quests in a\ntop-down manner: the classification, for each class the path components, and\nfor each component the homotopy type (as loosely analogous to the those three\nfor studying the moduli of smooth structures: exotic manifolds, mapping class\ngroups, and Smale-type conjectures). The last of the three is\ninfinite-dimensional in nature, as the corresponding moduli space is shown to\ninherit the structure of a smooth Fr\\'echet manifold from the diffeomorphism\ngroup through a (infinite-dimensional) principal bundle, with which we\nestablish further connections with the Lie theory of gauge symmetries from one\nperspective, and with the geometric analysis of extrinsic flows from another.\nConcretely, we tackle the problem of finding the \"homotopy core\": a minimal\ndeformation retract that encodes the topological structure of such a moduli\nspace of fibrations; as our first examples, we gave explicit homotopy\ncalculations for various low-dimensional cases which, combined with earlier\nknown cases from others' work, complete the solution to this problem for\ndimensions up to three."}
