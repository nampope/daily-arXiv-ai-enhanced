We prove that under the axiom of constructibility (i.e. {V=L}), homeomorphism groups of arbitrary connected manifolds are first-order rigid, and that the conjugacy class of a homeomorphism of a manifold is determined by its type. In contradistinction, under projective determinacy (PD), we show that in all dimensions greater than one, there exist pairs of noncompact, connected manifolds whose homeomorphism groups are elementarily equivalent but which are not homeomorphic. We also show that under PD, every manifold of positive dimension admits pairs of homeomorphisms with the same type which are not conjugate to each other. Finally, we show that infinitary sentences do determine conjugacy classes of homeomorphisms and homeomorphism types of manifolds; specifically, the conjugacy class of a homeomorphism of an arbitrary manifold is determined by a single $L_{ω_1ω}$ sentence. Similarly, the homeomorphism type of an arbitrary connected manifold is determined by a single $L_{ω_1ω}$ sentence."}

These genera yield a natural filtration of the set of long virtual knots, and we analyze the behavior of the intersection polynomials for long virtual knots with small supporting genera. Moreover, we investigate virtual $2$-string tangles, analyzing how their sums with long virtual knots affect the intersection polynomials through right closures. As an application, we provide complete realizability criteria for all twelve intersection polynomials."}

Building on the Birman-Williams approach to Lorenz knots and following the notion of modular knots introduced by Ghys, this article investigates the topological $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$-invariants arising from modular knots. Our main focus is the Alexander polynomial of modular knots. Using the Burau representation, we highlight two contrasting features of this family. On the one hand, for each fixed degree, only finitely many Alexander polynomials of modular knots occur. On the other hand, any integer appears as a coefficient of the Alexander polynomial of some modular knot, and coefficients of the same sign can occur in runs of arbitrarily long length."}

The minimum size of such decompositions for a harmonic polynomial is called its isotropic rank. As with the Waring rank, the problem of determining the isotropic rank of a given harmonic form is very hard. We determine the isotropic rank of a general harmonic form providing a full classification of the dimensions of secant varieties of the variety of d-powers of isotropic linear forms in n+1 variables, for every n,d, thus obtaining the analogue of the widely-celebrated Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem. Moreover, we completely solve the problem of determining the isotropic rank for the following classes of harmonic forms: ternary forms, quadrics and monomials."}

An expectation, related to Kim's conjecture, is that for $X$ hyperbolic, the set of augmentations which come locally at each place of $k$ from a point is equal to the set of rational points. Our view is that this should provide a relative of the Grothendieck section conjecture which may be both more accessible, and more directly applicable, than the latter.\n  As a first step in this direction, we extend aspects of the ``Weil height machine'' to the set of such augmentations, and use this to prove a Manin--Dem'janenko-style finiteness result for motivic augmentations for particular curves. Along the way, we determine the structure of the cohomological motive of a $\\mathbb{G}_m$-bundle over an algebraic variety as a highly structured algebra in the derived $\\infty$-category of mixed motives with rational coefficients."}
