We ask whether the\nAlexander--Conway polynomial together with different types of quandle\ninvariants suffice. We show that the conjugation quandle of the dihedral group\n$D_5$, together with the Alexander--Conway polynomial, does distinguish the two\nlinks and hence likely does detect causality in $X$. The $2$-sky link shares\nthe same Alexander--Conway polynomial but has different $D_5$\nconjugation-quandle counting invariants. Moreover, for $D_5$ the counting\ninvariant alone already separates the pair, whereas for other small dihedral\ngroups $D_3$, $D_4$, $D_6$, $D_7$ even the enhanced counting polynomial fails\nto detect causality. In fact we prove more that the conjugation quandle over D5\ndistinguishes all the infinitely many Allen-Swenberg links from the connected\nsum of two Hopf links. These results present an interesting reality where only\nthe conjugation quandle over $D_5$ coupled with the Alexander--Conway\npolynomial can detect causality in $(2+1)$ dimensions. This results in a\nsimple, computable quandle that can determine causality via the counting\ninvariant alone, rather than reaching for more complicated counting polynomials\nand cocycles."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Yang-Baxter operators (YBOs) have been employed to construct quantum knot\ninvariants. More recently, cohomology theories for YBOs have been independently\ndeveloped, drawing inspiration from analogous theories for quandles and other\ndiscrete algebraic structures. Quandle cohomology, in particular, gives rise to\ncocycle invariants for knots via $2$-cocycles, which are closely related to\nquandle extensions, and knotted surfaces via $3$-cocycles. These quandle\ncocycle knot invariants have also been shown to admit interpretations as\nquantum invariants. Similarly, $2$-cocycles in Yang-Baxter cohomology can be\ninterpreted in terms of deformations of YBOs. Building on these parallels, we\nintroduce quantum cocycle invariants of knots using $2$-cocycles of Yang-Baxter\ncohomology, from the perspective of deformation theory. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that the quandle cocycle invariant can be interpreted in this\nframework, while the quantum version yields stronger invariants in certain\nexamples. We develop our theory along two primary approaches to quantum\ninvariants: via trace constructions and through (co)pairings. Explicit examples\nare provided, including those based on the Kauffman bracket. Furthermore, we\nshow that both the Jones and Alexander polynomials can be derived within this\nframework as invariants arising from higher-order formal Laurent polynomial\ndeformations via Yang-Baxter cohomology."}
