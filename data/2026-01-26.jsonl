Comments welcome!", "summary": "We prove that for knots, the evaluation of the Jones polynomial at the sixth root of unity, as well as the evaluation of the $Q$-polynomial at the reciprocal of the golden ratio, are uniquely determined by the oriented homeomorphism type of the double branched covering. We provide explicit formulae for these evaluations in terms of the linking pairing. The proof proceeds via so-called singular determinants, from which we also extract new lower bounds for the unknotting numbers of knots and links."}

We show that $M$ is diffeomorphic to a trivial bundle $T^n\\times \\mathbb{R}^m$ over a torus $T^n$ if the first cohomology $H^1(V)$ of $V$ vanishes. Moreover, in general, we show that $M$ is diffeomorphic to a trivial bundle $T^{b_1(M)}\\times \\mathbb{R}^m$ over a $b_1(M)$-dimensional torus $T^{b_1(M)}$, or a trivial bundle $E\\times \\mathbb{R}^m$ such that $E$ is a torus bundle $E\\rightarrow T^{b_1(M)}$ over a torus $T^{b_1(M)}$.

Significant effort has been devoted to extending this result to modules defined over more general posets. As these modules do not generally admit nice decompositions, one must restrict attention to the class of interval-decomposable modules in order to define an appropriate notion of bottleneck distance. Even with this assumption, it is known that bottleneck distance may not be equivalent to interleaving distance, but that it is Lipschitz stable under certain, fairly restrictive, assumptions. In this paper, we consider the more basic question of stability of the Hausdorff distance with respect to interleaving distance for interval-decomposable modules. Our main theorem is a Lipschitz stability result, which holds in a fairly general setting of interval-decomposable modules over arbitrary posets, where intervals are assumed to be taken from any family satisfying certain closure conditions. Along the way, we develop some new tools and results for interval-decomposable modules over arbitrary posets, in the form of geometrically-flavored characterizations of the existence of morphisms and interleavings between interval modules."}

Thick sets are proven to be winning for the matrix potential game introduced in (arXiv:2508.11577) and as an application we can prove that for a thick set, there exists $M\\in\\mathbb{N}$ depending on the thickness of the set, such that the set contains a homothetic copy of every finite set with at most $M$ elements. Additionally, the author provides a counter-example to the gap lemma in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\\geq 2$) for Falconer-Yavicoli thickness, stated in (Math. Z., 2022) proving this result does not hold in the generality stated. We go on to provide a gap lemma for affine thickness in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (for $n\\geq 2$) under additional conditions to the classical Newhouse gap lemma."}
