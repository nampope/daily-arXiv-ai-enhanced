Comments welcome!", "summary": "We extend Jones' construction to obtain a surjective map from the Brown-Thompson group $F_3$ to the set of pointed links up to pointed isotopy. We then introduce an operation on $F_3$, and use it to define a new monoid $(F_3, \\diamond)$, called the central monoid. Using the extended version of Jones' construction, we obtain a surjective monoid homomorphism from the central monoid to the monoid of pointed links with connected sum. This allows us to introduce a standard form for connected sum representatives in $F_3$, and we extend this construction to a certain family of links by defining disjoint union and linking moves on $F_3$."}

In this article, we study the algebraic hyperbolicity of a very general section of the adjoint linear series $|K_X+mL|$ when the tangent bundle $T_X$ of $X$ has suitable positivity properties. As a consequence, we show that the linear system $|K_X+mL|$ is hyperbolic (or pseudo-hyperbolic) for $m\\geq 3n+1$, for various classes of polarized pairs $(X,L)$, thus providing new evidence of a conjecture that was proposed by the second and fourth authors. Moreover, when $X$ is abelian, we show that the linear system $|mL|$ is hyperbolic for $m\\geq n$, and the same holds when $m\\geq n-1$, if $|L|$ has no base divisors. It turns out that these bounds for abelian varieties are sharp. We also prove analogous statements for Kummer varieties and certain classes of hyperelliptic varieties."}

This is due to Brugallé and does not involve any tropical geometry.\n  The second lecture explores the relations with tropical geometry, and contains an introduction to toric varieties and tropical geometry. We discuss the correspondence theorem of Mikhalkin, and show how the corresponding tropical enumerative problem can be formulated in terms of the combinatorial problem of counting floor diagrams. We give many examples throughout, inspired by the study of the enumerative geometry of $K3$ surfaces, by degeneration to unions of rational surfaces with dual complex a tiling of the $\\mathbf{S}^2$ sphere."}

In contrast, we prove that in characteristic $2$ there exists a unique Enriques surface that admits an automorphism with dynamical degree $λ_{10}$. We also provide explicit equations for the surface as well as for all conjugacy classes of automorphisms that realize $λ_{10}$."}

Our approach combines a refined restriction theorem for tilt-stable objects with explicit Clifford-type bounds for semistable bundles on plane quintic curves. As a consequence, we obtain an explicit piecewise linear inequality on the Chern characters of any slope-semistable sheaf improving upon the classical Bogomolov--Gieseker bound and implying Toda's conjectural inequality.\n  The method also yields a stronger Bogomolov--Gieseker type inequality on smooth quintic surfaces.\n  These results provide new evidence toward the existence of a Bridgeland stability condition of Gepner type on the quintic threefold."}

He verified in small cases that their coefficients can be expressed in terms of certain $q$-zeta values and that the polynomials recover the Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces studied by Mirzakhani under a certain $q \\to 1$ limit. In this paper, we provide mathematically rigorous proofs of these two phenomena. The authors previously defined natural $q$-deformations of the Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of curves. We prove that these polynomials appear as the top degree part of Okuyama's polynomials. Our work provides a link between the two topics of the title, which hints at a ``quantum'' Weil-Petersson geometry and a combinatorial-geometric approach to double-scaled SYK correlators."}
