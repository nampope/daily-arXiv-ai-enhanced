This fills what seems to be a gap in the literature concerning the existence of such train tracks. The construction starts with an invariant train track associated to the veering triangulation of the mapping torus of the homeomorphism and then uses the veering property to characterize branches which obstruct irreducibility, finally modifying the track to bypass these obstructions."}

K. Ohshika, A.

Although the theory for orientable surfaces is well established, the nonorientable case presents unique challenges due to the presence of crosscaps, thus requiring generators beyond Dehn twists. We show that, for a sufficiently large genus $g$, both $\\mathrm{Mod}(N_{g})$ and $\\mathcal{T}_{g}$ are generated by two elements, which is the minimum possible number. The survey details various types of generating sets, including those composed of torsions, involutions, and commutators, illustrating the geometric and algebraic interplay. We unify foundational work with modern breakthroughs and extend results to punctured surfaces, $\\mathrm{Mod}(N_{g,p})$, providing explicit generators, relations, and proof sketches with an emphasis on geometric intuition."}

K. Ohshika, A. Papadopoulos)", "summary": "The mapping class group of an orientable surface, which records its symmetries up to isotopy, plays a central role in low-dimensional topology. This chapter explores the foundational problem of determining minimal generating sets for these groups. We chart the development of this area from classical results involving Dehn twist generators to more recent breakthroughs showing that mapping class groups can be generated by just two elements, pairs of torsion elements, or a small collection of involutions. This chapter contains a discussion of the most current results for punctured surfaces, including a new improvement showing that for an even number of punctures $p\\geq 8$ the group $\\mathrm{Mod}(Σ_{13,p})$ is generated by three involutions. Throughout, we highlight the rich interplay between the algebraic features of these generating sets and the underlying geometric structures they encode. The chapter aims to provide a comprehensive account of the pursuit of algebraic and geometric efficiency within one of topology's most intricate and influential groups."}
