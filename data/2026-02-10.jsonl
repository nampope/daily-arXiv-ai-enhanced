Such geometric constraint systems arise in many real-world scenarios such as structural engineering and soft matter physics. When a geometric constraint system is flexible, it admits continuous deformations. The ability to explicitly compute such continuous motions is essential for analyzing the constraint system's quasistatic or elastic properties. However, this task is computationally challenging, even for comparatively simple geometric constraint systems, making numerical strategies attractive.\n  In this article, we present a general numerical framework for approximating continuous motions of geometric constraint systems given by quadratic polynomials. Our approach combines Riemannian optimization with numerical algebraic geometry to construct continuous motions via the metric projection onto the constraint set. By using homotopy continuation, we ensure that the computed motions correspond to genuine solutions of the constraint system and avoid numerical artifacts such as path-jumping. To handle singularities and over-determined systems, we introduce theoretical enhancements including randomization, adaptive step size control and a second-order analysis. These methods are implemented in the Julia package DeformationPaths.jl, which supports a broad class of geometric constraint systems and demonstrates its robust and effective performance across a wide range of test cases."}

This notion generalizes that of zonotopes which are Minkowksi sums of line segments. Taking the limit of the number of line segments to infinity yields the class of convex bodies called zonoids, which can also be viewed as the expectation of a random line segment. Expanding on this interpretation, we analogously define operanoids as the expectation of a random affine image of an operator norm ball. In studying the properties of operanoids when the dimension of the operator norm ball grows, we arrive at a new asymptotic regime for limits of convex bodies. This leads to the more general class of convex bodies called noncommutative zonoids, and we use the framework of free probability theory to illustrate basic properties and examples.

The celebrated poset fiber theorem of Björner, Wachs, and Welker describes the homotopy type of such inflation in terms of homotopy types of $K$ and its links. In the current paper, we introduce more general inflations over simplicial posets: we replace each simplex with an arbitrary finite set of copies. The way how these sets patch together is specified by a commutative diagram, or, equivalently, a sheaf on the corresponding finite topology. The generalized inflation can be understood as étale space of such sheaf. We prove that, whenever this inflation sheaf is flabby, the poset fiber theorem still applies. We prove all results similar to those known for vertex inflations. We also cover the previous result of the first author about homotopy types of clique complexes of multigraphs."}

In this approach, regimes are identified using a density--radius bifiltration combined with persistent homology, a well-established tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). This topological perspective provides a unifying view of regimes and, unlike traditional methods, does not require the number of regimes to be specified in advance.
