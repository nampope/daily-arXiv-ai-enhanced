Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over a field of\narbitrary characteristic. We calculate the motivic classes of the moduli stacks\nof semistable Higgs bundles on $X$. This recovers results of Fedorov, A.\nSoibelman and Y. Soibelman in characteristic zero, as well as those of Mozgovoy\nand Schiffmann for finite fields. We also obtain a simpler formula for the\nmotivic classes of Higgs bundles in the universal $\\lambda$-ring quotient using\nMellit's results."}

The 3D index, originally introduced by Dimofte, Gaiotto and Gukov,\nis a physically inspired q-series that encodes deep topological and geometric\ninformation about cusped 3-manifolds. Building on the interpretation of the 3D\nindex as a generating function over Q-normal surfaces, we introduce a relative\nversion of the index for ideal triangulations with exposed boundary. This\nnotion allows us to formulate a relative Gang-Yonekura formula, which we prove\nby developing a gluing principle for relative indices and establishing an\ninductive framework in the case of layered solid tori. Our approach makes use\nof Garoufalidis-Kashaev's meromorphic extension of the index, along with new\nidentities involving q-hypergeometric functions. As an application, we study\nthe limiting behaviour of the index for large fillings. We also develop code to\nperform certified computations of the index, guaranteeing correctness up to a\nspecified accuracy. Our extensive computations support the topological\ninvariance of the 3D index and suggest a well-defined extension to closed\nmanifolds."}

Also,\nit was proved recently that the other specialization of the Solomon-Terao\nbi-polynomial, we call the Solomon-Terao polynomial, coincides with the\nPoinrar\\'{e} polynomial of the regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety when the\narrangement and the variety comes from the same lower ideal in the positive\nsystem. Moreover, there are recent developments with superspace coinvariants\nand Fields conjecture, thus these polynomials are becoming more and more\nimportant. However, the research of them has been very hard, and even the top\ndegree of the Solomon-Terao polynomial has not yet been known, which we solve\nin this article, by using the Castelnouvo-Mumford regularity of the logarithmic\nderivation modules."}

In a previous work we studied this involution for\n$n=3$, with the help of the exceptional Lie group $G_2$, since the Mukai model\nof $S$ is embedded in its projectivized Lie algebra. Here we use different,\nmore general arguments to show that some important features of the birational\ninvolution persist for $n\\ge 4$. In particular, we describe the indeterminacy\nlocus of the involution in terms of a Mori contraction, and deduce that it is\nbirational to a $\\mathbb{P}^2$-fibration over a moduli space of sheaves on $S$,\nthat also admits a degree two nef and big line bundle and an induced birational\ninvolution."}
