By applying a weighted blow-up, we derive the meromorphic continuation of $Z_{f,\\varphi}$ to $\\text{Re }s > -1$. This explicit expression yields a necessary and sufficient condition for a root $s \\in (-1, 0)$ of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial $b_f(s)$ to be a pole of $Z_{f,\\varphi}$. Unlike the complex case established by F. Loeser (1985), this condition may fail in certain obvious cases -- such as when $f$ is odd or even in $x$, $y$, or $(x, y)$ -- so not all such roots necessarily become poles."}
