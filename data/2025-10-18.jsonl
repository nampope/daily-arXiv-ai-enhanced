Conversely, for GIT semistable cubic hypersurfaces, we prove a uniform\nlower bound for the minimal exponent, which implies that every such cubic has\ncanonical singularities (and is terminal for $n\\ge 6$), answering a question of\nSpotti-Sun. In the classical cases $(n,d)=(2,4),(2,6),(3,3),(4,3),(5,3)$, the\nperiod map from the GIT moduli is an open embedding over the stable locus with\n$\\widetilde \\alpha(X)>\\frac{n+1}{d}$ and extends regularly to the Baily-Borel\ncompactification precisely along the boundary where $\\widetilde\n\\alpha(X)=\\frac{n+1}{d}$. To generalize this period map behavior in the\nCalabi-Yau type case $\\frac{n+1}{d}=m+1\\in \\mathbb Z$, we introduce $m$-liminal\nsources and $m$-liminal centers, refining the theory of sources and log\ncanonical centers. For an $m$-Du Bois hypersurface, we prove that the core of\nthe limit mixed Hodge structure of any one-parameter smoothing is completely\ndetermined by the $m$-liminal source. In particular, maximal unipotent\ndegeneration is detected by the local singularity type of the special fiber."}
