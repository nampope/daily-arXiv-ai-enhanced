Let\n$u(M)=u^F(M)$ be the Lie algebra of the subgroup of the Tannakian fundamental\ngroup of $M$ that acts trivially on the associated graded $Gr^FM$. The\nfiltration $F_\\bullet M$ induces a filtration on the internal Hom\n$\\underline{Hom}(M,M)$, which in turn induces a filtration $F_\\bullet u(M)$ on\n$u(M)$. This filtration on $u(M)$ is concentrated in negative degrees. In this\npaper, we give a description of the graded piece $Gr^F_{-1}u( M)$ in terms of\nthe extensions $F_{r+1}M/F_{r-1}M\\in Ext^1(Gr^F_{r+1}M, Gr^F_{r}M)$. In\nparticular, these extensions determine $Gr^F_{-1}u(M)$. Note that here we\nneither assume the filtration is functorial, nor we assume that $Gr^FM$ is\nsemisimple. The problem of studying $u(M)$ in this generality is motivated by\nthe desire to understand Tannakian groups associated to a mixed motive and its\nrealizations, including realizations for which semisimplicity of realizations\nof pure motives is not known and realizations that lack an interesting\nfunctorial weight filtration.\n  We also give two related applications. The first is an equivalent condition\nin the generality described above for when $u(M)$ coincides with its trivial\nupper bound $F_{-1}\\underline{Hom}(M,M)$. This result generalizes earlier\ncriteria for maximality of $u(M)$ obtained by various authors in special\ncontexts or under limiting conditions. In the second application, we apply the\nresults to the setting of a neutral Tannakian category with a functorial weight\nfiltration $W_\\bullet$. Combining the constructions of [arXiv:2307.15487] with\nour general maximality criterion we prove a result about the structure of the\nset of isomorphism classes of objects $M$ for which $Gr^WM$ is isomorphic to a\ngiven graded object $A$ and $u^W(M)=W_{-1}\\underline{Hom}(M,M)$."}

Log spaces in the sense of Fontaine and Illusie were first described in\nprint by Kato, in a 1988 paper. Rounding of complex log spaces was introduced\nin a 1999 paper by Kato and Nakayama and is a functorial generalization of\nA'Campo's 1975 notion of a real oriented blowup. It allows to cut canonically\nany complex toroidal variety $X$ along its toroidal boundary $\\partial X$,\nproducing a topological manifold-with-boundary, whose boundary is a canonical\nrepresentative of the boundary of any tubular neighborhood of $\\partial X$ in\n$X$. In singularity theory, roundings may be used to get canonical\nrepresentatives of links of isolated complex analytic singularities and of\nMilnor fibers of smoothings of complex singularities, once toroidal resolutions\nof the singularity or of the smoothing are chosen. The text starts with\nintroductions to not necessarily normal toric varieties, it passes then to\ntoroidal varieties and to their real oriented blowups. It continues with\nintroductions to log spaces and to rounding of complex log spaces. It concludes\nwith an important theorem of Nakayama and Ogus about the local triviality of\nthe rounding of special types of log morphisms. The notions of affine toric\nvariety, real oriented blowup, log structure and rounding are introduced by\nmeans of the classical passage to polar coordinates."}

Critically, we develop a comprehensive proof strategy to establish the\nconverse: the vanishing of this refined fingerprint across all realization\nfunctors (de Rham and $\\ell$adic) implies the class is absolute Hodge. By\nfundamental theorems in arithmetic algebraic geometry, absolute Hodge classes\nof type $(k,k)$ are equivalent to algebraic cycles. This framework offers a\nnew, robust criterion for detecting algebraic cycles, reformulating the\nconjecture into a problem of establishing the exhaustive spanning properties of\nGaussManin derivatives and Galois actions within their respective cohomology\nspaces. While building upon established deep results, this approach provides a\nfresh perspective and a pathway towards a complete resolution."}
