In this paper, we study\nthe topology of the space $\\mathfrak{R}(\\lambda,d)$ of conjugacy classes of\n$d$-pleated surfaces with pleating locus $\\lambda$.

The Hodge atoms\narise from the spectral decomposition of the F-bundle under the Euler vector\nfield action, and behave additively under blowups, in accordance with Iritani's\nblowup theorem.
