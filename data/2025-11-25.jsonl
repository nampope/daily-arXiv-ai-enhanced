In the case of curves inside symplectic surfaces, previously studied by Donagi-Ein-Lazarsfeld, the corresponding deformation to the normal cone space is an open subset of the relative moduli space of sheaves. As an application, we show generalized Kummer varieties degenerate to natural symplectic subvarieties of the Hitchin system for curves of genus at least 2."}

We also provide new examples of toric varieties with prescribed singularities that are not resolved by the normalized Nash blowup, including cyclic quotient singularities, toric hypersurfaces, and Q-factorial Gorenstein singularities. In addition, we report extensive computational evidence: tens of thousands of two-dimensional toric varieties that are resolved by iterating the Nash blowup, and millions of three-dimensional toric varieties that are resolved by iterating the normalized Nash blowup. This provides positive evidence for the remaining open cases of the conjectures."}
