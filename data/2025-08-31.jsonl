Beginning in a brief review of some basic\nsettings of profinite completion and rigidity of general groups, we state the\ncomplete results in profinite detection of 3-manifold decompositions and\nprofinite rigidity or nonrigidity of other types of 3-manifolds, which reduce\nthe problem to the hyperbolic case. Then we give some evidence to a positive\nanswer and conclude some existing ideas toward the remained hyperbolic case. We\nalso summarize the methods and techniques used in the process."}

While every\nnon-$\\pi_1$-injective map between compact surfaces admits a geometric kernel,\nthis generally fails for compact bordered or non-compact surfaces. In this\npaper, we use Brown's proper fundamental group to give a sufficient condition\nunder which a degree-one map between non-compact surfaces admits a geometric\nkernel. Furthermore, we characterize conjugacy classes in the proper\nfundamental group and use this characterization to establish sufficient\nconditions for the existence of geometric kernels."}
