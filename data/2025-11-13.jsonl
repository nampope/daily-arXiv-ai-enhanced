Comments welcome!", "summary": "We define a general procedure extending surgery to manifolds with foliation or Haefliger structure, the resulting Haefliger structure defined on the underlying surgered manifold. We find a single obstruction, whose vanishing characterizes the existence of a foliation surgery along an attaching sphere. When unobstructed, the resulting Haefliger structure can be chosen so that characteristic numbers are unchanged. Moreover, the obstructions are highly tractable for attaching spheres of dimension small relative the foliation codimension. This allows us to show that on every stably trivial manifold of dimension \\( n \\le 2q+2 \\), a codimension-\\( q \\) Haefliger structure with trivial normal bundle admits a sequence of foliation surgeries to a Haefliger structure on the sphere \\( S^{n} \\), characteristic numbers unchanged.\n  The obstruction always vanishes for \\( 0 \\)-sphere surgeries. It follows that the foliation connected sum gives, for each sphere \\( S^{n} \\) and codimension \\( q \\), a group structure on the set of concordance classes of transversely oriented Haefliger structures on \\( S^{n} \\). The resulting groups may be identified with the homotopy groups of the Haefliger classifying spaces \\( BΓ^{+}_{q} \\). Using this, we recover a result of Hurder that \\( π_{2q+1}(BΓ^{+}_{q}) \\) surjects onto a vector space of positive dimension for each codimension \\( q \\). We also apply the techniques here to a construction of Thurston's, to construct explicit Haefliger structures on \\( (2q+1) \\)-spheres whose Godbillon-Vey numbers surject to the real line."}

These objects admit planar representative diagrams, considered up to a suitable set of Reidemeister-type moves. To develop the associated braid-theoretic framework, we define twisted virtual twin groups as natural extensions of virtual twin groups, and establish Alexander- and Markov-type theorems in this set-up. This shows that twisted virtual doodles unify and extend both classical and virtual doodle theories. We further investigate the structure of the pure twisted virtual twin group, providing a presentation and deriving several structural and combinatorial properties. In particular, we obtain two interesting decompositions of the twisted virtual twin group and its pure subgroup, from which it follows that both groups have trivial center and are residually finite as well as Hopfian."}

Some milestones have been achieved, for example, Rodin-Sullivan \\cite{Rodin-Sullivan} and Schramm \\cite{schramm91} proved the rigidity of infinite CPs with the intersection angle $Θ=0$. Rivin-Hodgson \\cite{RH93} fully characterized the existence and rigidity of compact convex polyhedra in $\\mathbb{H}^3$. He \\cite{He} proved the rigidity and uniformization theorem for infinite CPs with $0\\leqΘ\\leq π/2$. \\cite{He} also envisioned that \"in a future paper, the techniques of this paper will be extended to the case when $0\\leqΘ<π$. In particular, we will show a rigidity property for a class of infinite convex polyhedra in the 3-dimentional hyperbolic space\".\n  The article aims to accomplish the work claimed in \\cite{He} by proving the rigidity and uniformization theorem for infinite CPs with $0\\leqΘ<π$, as well as infinite trivalent hyperbolic polyhedra. We will pay special attention to CPs whose contact graphs are disk triangulation graphs. Such CPs are called regular because they exclude some singular configurations and correspond well to hyperbolic polyhedra. We will establish the existence and the rigidity of infinite regular CPs. Moreover, we will prove a uniformization theorem for regular CPs, which solves the classification problem for regular CPs. Thereby, the existence and rigidity of infinite convex trivalent polyhedra are obtained."}

Along the way, we clarify the relationship between several notions of L-classes appearing in the literature, but we also include many new cases for which the conjecture is true, e.g., all compact toric varieties, all (matroid) Schubert varieties, all Richardson and intersection varieties, all projective simply connected spherical varieties, and all compact complex algebraic surfaces and threefolds."}

We study generalizations for many of the equivalent conditions characterizing them to obtain in this way a larger class of ADLVs that still have a similarly good and computable description of their geometry.

The germ $(S,0)$ is quasi-ordinary if $(S,0)$ has a finite projection to $(\\mathbb{C}^d,0)$ which is unramified outside the coordinate hyperplanes. This implies that the normalization of $S$ is a toric singularity. One has also a monomial variety associated to $S$, which is a toric singularity with the same normalization, and with possibly higher embedding dimension. Since $(S,0)$ is quasi-ordinary, the extension of the Jacobian ideal of $S$ to the local ring of its normalization is a monomial ideal. We describe this monomial ideal by comparing it with the {\\em logarithmic Jacobian ideals} of $S$ and of its associated monomial variety and we give some applications."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "In this article, we prove various results about six-functor formalisms and morphisms between them. In particular, we show that the stable motivic homotopy theory of algebraic stacks is the universal six-functor functor formalism in a strong sense: it is initial in some category whose objects are six-functor formalisms, and whose morphisms commute with the six operations. This strengthens previous results of this form, which only showed that stable motivic homotopy theory is a six-functor formalism, and is initial, but not that the morphisms from it commute with the six operations.\n  We also prove a similar result for the stable motivic homotopy theory of complex analytic stacks, and produce a Betti realization for stacks that commutes with Grothendieck's six operations, generalizing previous results of Ayoub for quasi-projective schemes.\n  In order to do this, we give a generalized and enhanced account of Voevodsky's geometric criterion for six-functor formalisms. Our version of Voevodsky's principle makes sense in more general geometric contexts (not only algebraic geometry), and also provides a criterion for showing that a morphism between six-functor formalisms is compatible with the six operations."}

This proves a recent conjecture of the second author, rounding up the line of exploration in the series of work by the authors and Jiang. The equality between the $2m$-fold multisum and the $m$-fold Bressoud sum is built upon generalizing the multisum by introducing a ``ghost'' parameter $a$ to its summands. We then show that such an $a$-generalization is surprisingly $a$-independent by purely $q$-theoretic techniques. Finally, we propose a refined multisum that interpolates two versions of Quot zeta functions for all three types of quadratic orders."}
