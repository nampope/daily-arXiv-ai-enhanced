We build families of generalized cusps of non-maximal rank associated to each strictly convex or round cusp. We also extend Ballas-Cooper-Leitner's definition of generalized cusp to allow for virtually solvable fundamental group, and we produce the first such example with non-virtually nilpotent fundamental group.\n  Along with a companion paper, this allows to build strictly convex cusps and generalized cusps whose fundamental group is any finitely generated virtually nilpotent group. This also has interesting consequences for the theory of relatively Anosov representations."}

Instead of gluing singular solid tori into rank $2$ cusps, we glue singular $2$-handles into rank $1$ cusps. Our method is to find substructures within which the hyperbolic metric can be `fractured' in a controlled way by direct manipulation of a fundamental polyhedron, changing the cone angle around an ideal arc to interpolate between cusped hyperbolic manifolds and hyperbolic manifolds with conformal surfaces on the visual boundary. As an application, we use cone deformations of a family of arithmetic manifolds derived from the Borromean rings to show that the upper unknotting tunnels of highly twisted $2$-bridge links can be drilled out by cone deformations. We also show that our structures arise naturally in fully augmented links, providing a large family of examples."}

Their work follows the line of Schober's previous polyhedral analysis of the Bierstone--Milman invariant. In this paper, we extend their graphical approach to varieties of arbitrary (co)dimension in characteristic zero. This yields a factorial reduction in complexity in comparison with Abramovich--Temkin--Wlodarczyk, as previously achieved by Wlodarczyk. Our approach builds on the formalism of weighted blow-ups via filtrations of ideals developed and used by Loizides--Meinrenken, Quek--Rydh and Wlodarczyk, and on its interplay with systems of parameters.
