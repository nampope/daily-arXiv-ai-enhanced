Let $d_g(G)$ be the minimal possible $n$ for $(Σ_g,G)$. We compute the value of $d_g(G)$ in certain cases.

When the projective space is the plane, this is trivial. For projective 3 space this problem was solved independently by Diaz and by Giuffrida in 1986. They showed that two curves achieving the maximum number of intersection points have to be rational curves on a smooth surface of minimal degree, i.e., a quadric surface. Note that these curves are far from being arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay. In contrast, Hartshorne and Miró-Roig addressed this problem in 2015 for space curves under the assumption that the curves are arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (ACM), introducing very deep techniques and obtaining very different results from Diaz and Giuffrida. Diaz and Giuffrida also gave initial results in dimensions greater than 3. Here we continue this study for dimension 4. We introduce a number B defined in terms of the degrees of the curves and prove that when both curves lie on a surface of minimal degree (thus a cubic surface) then the number of points of intersection is at most B. Moreover, we conjecture that B is always an upper bound and we prove this conjecture in many cases, including when at least one of the curves is ACM. Our approach focuses on the genera of the curves and their union. In addition we define a second number B' in terms of the degrees and the genus of the union which we can show bounds the number of points of intersection above, and we use a variety of methods to study how B and B' compare."}

Computing this model is a central problem in arithmetic geometry. For non-hyperelliptic genus $3$ curves, which are canonically embedded as plane quartics, methods like admissible reduction become challenging in small residue characteristics. This thesis establishes a precise connection between the abstractly defined stable model and computationally accessible GIT-stable plane models. We prove that a GIT-stable plane model of a smooth plane quartic exists if and only if its stable reduction is non-hyperelliptic. When this condition holds, we show that the stable model is the unique minimal semistable model that dominates the GIT-stable model. The corresponding domination morphism is geometrically explicit: it contracts the $1$-tails of the stable reduction to cusps on the special fiber of the GIT-stable model and is an immersion elsewhere. This result provides a geometric framework for computing the stable model by first finding a GIT-stable model and then resolving its cuspidal singularities."}

Our result holds over an algebraically closed field whose characteristic does not divide the degree of the polynomial defining the hypersurface. Finally, in the analytic complex case, we conclude that the normalization of an irreducible Puiseux hypersurface is the normalization of a complex analytic quasi-ordinary singularity."}
