For compactified Picard\nschemes, our approach yields relative quasi-smooth derived enhancements of the\nQuot schemes $\\mathrm{Quot}_{\\omega/X/S}^d$ and, in the Gorenstein case, of the\nHilbert schemes of points $\\mathrm{Hilb}_{X/S}^d$ on $X/S$. These constructions\nnaturally generalize to higher rank torsion-free sheaves and their coherent\nsystems.\n  We obtain unified semiorthogonal decompositions for the derived categories of\nthese derived moduli spaces, broadly extending previous results for symmetric\npowers, varieties of linear series, and Thaddeus pairs to torsion-free sheaves\non integral curves.\n  Central to our approach are two novel tools of independent interest: the\n$\\mathcal{Q}$-complex, a derived generalization of Grothendieck's $Q$-module\nand the Altman--Kleiman $H$-module, and a derived theory of moduli of\nextensions that extends Lange's classical framework."}
