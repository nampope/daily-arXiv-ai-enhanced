This viewpoint provides a conceptual reinterpretation of classical results of Griffiths, Green, and Voisin, and extends them to settings involving singular varieties and equisingular deformations. The resulting framework yields a geometric explanation for the appearance of Jacobian rings in infinitesimal Hodge theory and clarifies the structure of deformation spaces underlying Severi varieties and related moduli problems."}

This provides a formalism for approaching the higher Chow groups of the modular variety by special cycles and Borcherds products. The construction is an incorporation of the theory of Borcherds products and ideas from Milnor K-theory."}

In standard quantum information, entanglement is defined relative to a chosen tensor-product factorization of a fixed Hilbert space. In contrast, for a twisted family of pure-state spaces, which can be described by Azumaya algebras $A$ of degree $n$ on $X$ and their Severi-Brauer schemes \\[ SB(A)=P\\times^{PGL_n}\\mathbb{P}^{n-1}\\to X, \\] such a subsystem choice may fail to globalize. We formalize this algebro-geometrically: fixing a factorization type $\\mathbf d=(d_1,\\dots,d_s)$ with $n=\\prod_i d_i$, the existence of a global product-state locus of type $\\mathbf d$ is equivalent to a reduction of the underlying $PGL_n$-torsor $P\\to X$ to the stabilizer $G_{\\mathbf d}\\subset PGL_n$. Thus, entanglement is the obstruction to the existence of a relative Segre subscheme inside $SB(A)$.\n  Writing $Σ_{\\mathbf d}\\subset \\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ for the Segre variety, we call a reduction to $G_{\\mathbf d}$ a $\\mathbf d$-subsystem structure. Our first main result identifies the moduli of $\\mathbf d$-subsystem structures with the quotient $P/G_{\\mathbf d}$. Moreover, we realize naturally $P/G_{\\mathbf d}$ as a locally closed subscheme of the relative Hilbert scheme, \\[ \\text{Hilb}^{Σ_{\\mathbf d}}\\!\\bigl(SB(A)/X\\bigr)\\ \\subset\\ \\text{Hilb}\\bigl(SB(A)/X\\bigr), \\] parametrizing relative closed subschemes fppf-locally isomorphic to $Σ_{\\mathbf d}\\times X$."}

The first global vanishing result in the projective plane, known as the Euler-Jacobi theorem, was established by Jacobi in 1835. In the toric case, the input is a system of n Laurent sparse polynomials with fixed Newton polytopes, and the first version of the Euler-Jacobi toric vanishing theorem for residues in the n-torus is due to Khovanskii in 1978, under restrictive genericity assumptions. In this paper, we provide geometric conditions on the input Newton polytopes to ensure that this global vanishing is equivalent to the existence of zeros at infinity in the associated compact toric variety. We relate these conditions to the dimension at the toric critical degree of the quotient of the Cox ring by the ideal generated by the (multi)homogenizations of the input polynomials. We also relate the existence of zeros at infinity to interpolation questions."}

This construction generalizes the classical pair-of-pants decomposition for hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. In our first main theorem, we prove that the natural angle map associated to an essential projective hyperplane complement is a homotopy equivalence, extending earlier work of Salvetti and Björner-Ziegler. By a topological argument, we further show that the angle map for a finite Kummer covering of an essential projective hyperplane complement is likewise a homotopy equivalence. We then explain how these local building blocks can be glued along the dual intersection complex of a semistable degeneration. Using the theory of Kato-Nakayama spaces, we prove that the resulting space is homotopy equivalent to the original algebraic variety. We make this explicit for complete intersections in projective space using techniques from tropical geometry."}

Survey", "summary": "Since the first famous correspondence theorem by Mikhalkin appeared in 2005, tropical geometry has allowed a parallel treatment of real and complex counting problems. A prime example are the genus 0 Gromov-Witten invariants of the plane which count rational plane curves of degree d satisfying point conditions and their real counterpart, the Welschinger invariants, which both can be determined using tropical methods. Remarkably, the tropical computation of the two types of invariants works entirely in parallel. Recently, quadratically enriched enumerative geometry enables us to combine such real and complex counts under one roof, providing a simultaneous approach which can also be used for counts over other fields. Tropical geometry is a successful tool for the study and computation of such quadratically enriched enumerative invariants, too. In this survey, we provide an overview of tropical methods for plane curve counting problems over the real and complex numbers, and the new quadratically enriched counts."}
