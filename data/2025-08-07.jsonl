They include and\ngeneralize reduced double Bruhat cells, positroid varieties, open Bott-Samelson\nvarieties, and Richardson varieties, among others. Recently, two cluster\nalgebra structures were independently constructed in the coordinate rings of\nbraid varieties: one using weaves and the other using Deodhar geometry. The\nmain result of the article is that these two cluster algebras coincide. More\ngenerally, our comparative study matches the different concepts and results\nfrom each approach to the other, both on the combinatorial and algebraic\ngeometric aspects."}
