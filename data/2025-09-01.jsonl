We\nshow that if rho(X)>9, then X is a product of del Pezzo surfaces, thus\nimproving recent results by the author and by the author and S.A. Secci; the\nstatement is now optimal. In the range rho(X)=7,8,9 we show that if X is not a\nproduct of surfaces, and has no small elementary contraction, then it is the\nblow-up of a cubic 4-fold along a special configuration of planes. When instead\nrho(X)>6 and X has a small elementary contraction, we study X depending on its\nfixed prime divisors, giving explicit results on the geometry of X in the\nframework of birational geometry. In particular for the boundary case rho(X)=9\nwe show that either X is a product of surfaces, or X belongs to two explicit\nfamilies, or there is a sequence of flips X-->X' where X' is a smooth\nprojective 4-fold with an elementary contraction onto a 3-fold. In the paper we\nalso give several results on rational contractions of fiber type of Fano\n4-folds, and more generally of Mori dream spaces; in particular we use some\nproperties of del Pezzo surfaces over non-closed fields, applied to generic\nfibers."}

In\nthis paper we give a generalisation of Spencer cohomology suitable for singular\nschemes of finite type over a field. Our motivation was a conjecture of\nVinogradov concerning the homological properties of differential operators on\nsingular affine varieties; namely that certain complexes of such operators are\nacyclic if and only if the variety is smooth. We will provide a negative answer\nto Vinogradov's conjecture as stated. In principle Vinogradov's conjecture can\nalso be posed for the Spencer complex; however the answer is trivial, since\nsingularities prohibit a definition of Spencer cohomology with any good\nproperties. Our main result will be the construction of a Spencer complex on a\nlarge class of singular schemes which is suitable as a cohomology theory for\nthe space. Following this we are able to ask the same question as Vinogradov in\nthis case, where we give a more positive answer. Our main technique draws from\nHartshorne's construction of de Rham cohomology by formal completion."}
