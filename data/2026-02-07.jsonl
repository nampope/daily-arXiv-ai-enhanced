We introduce a notion of a K-copositive minimum and of perfect K-copositive matrices. We consider a key feature of a given cone, which we call Interior Ryshkov (IR) property. Under this property the classical theory and its applications generalize nicely and we prove that rationally generated cones possess this IR property. For contrast, we give a detailed example of a simple cone without the IR property, showing various differences to the classical case. Moreover, this example yields connections to questions of number theory, in particular to Diophantine approximation and the Pell Equation. Finally, as an application, we give inner and outer polyhedral approximations for the generalized completely positive cone and a method to find rational certificates for (non-)membership in this cone."}

It is known that, for positive pretzel knots, the $Δ$-unknotting number coincides with the second coefficient of their Conway polynomial. In this paper, we compute the $Δ$-unknotting number for positive pretzel knots. Furthermore, we determine the $Δ$-unknotting number for pretzel knots of type $P(-1, p_2, ..., p_n)$, where $p_i$ is a positive odd integer for $2 \\leq i \\leq n$ and $n$ is odd."}
