We first examine linear parameter systems obtained by replacing the usual convex hull by the $c$-hull $A^{cc}$, deriving consequences for volume along these $c$-paths. In particular, we obtain convexity statements in special cases and in dimension $2$, and we show by example that such convexity fails in general for $n\\ge 3$. We then focus on Steiner symmetrization. We prove that Steiner symmetrization increases the \\emph{dual volume} and that in the planar case Steiner symmetrals of ball-bodies remain ball-bodies. In contrast, we provide an explicit example in $\\RR^3$ showing that the Steiner symmetral of a ball-body need not belong to $\\mathcal S_n$, and show that there are such counter-examples with arbitrarily large curvatures."}

The arguably best-understood example is volume-maximization of convex bodies contained in other convex bodies, where the John decomposition describes$\\unicode{x2014}$and in the Euclidean case fully characterizes$\\unicode{x2014}$the optimal positions. For many other such problems, however, no general optimality conditions are known. To address this, we generalize an approach of O. B. Ader to obtain a John-type decomposition as a necessary condition for affinely-optimal containment chains, i.e., chains $r L_1 + c \\subseteq K \\subseteq R L_2 + d$ for convex bodies $K, L_1, L_2 \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$, translation vectors $c,d \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, and reals $r,R > 0$ such that the ratio $\\frac{R}{r}$ cannot be decreased by linearly transforming $K$. We again obtain sufficiency for optimality when ellipsoids are involved, and show how optimality conditions for various problems follow from our result. Our main applications concern the Banach-Mazur distance, where we provide necessary optimality conditions in the general case and a full characterization in the Euclidean case. Finally, we derive several consequences of these optimality conditions related to the Banach-Mazur distance to the Euclidean ball."}

This article extends the structural and decomposition theory of persistence modules to the more general setting of unitary left modules over Noetherian rings. We introduce the notion of a module of projective constant type, a generalization of interval modules that facilitates decomposition results. We characterize the existence of projective constant decompositions for pointwise finitely generated persistence modules indexed by $A_n$-type quivers, totally ordered sets, and zigzag posets. Our primary results establish that such decompositions exist if and only if specific algebraic criteria are met: the projective colimit conditions (PCC) for quiver and zigzag indexings, and the projectivity of cokernels of internal morphisms for totally ordered indexings. Furthermore, we provide corollaries for the existence of classical interval decompositions over Noetherian rings where finitely generated projective modules are free, such as principal ideal domains (PIDs). Finally, we establish the uniqueness of indecomposable projective constant decompositions within the Krull-Schmidt framework and extend the uniqueness of interval decompositions to persistence modules over integral domains."}
