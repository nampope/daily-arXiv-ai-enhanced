Comments welcome!", "summary": "Given two hyperbolic surfaces and a homotopy class of maps between them,\nThurston proved that there always exists a representative minimizing the\nLipschitz constant. While not unique, these minimizers are rigid along a\ngeodesic lamination. In this paper, we investigate what happens in the\ncomplement of that lamination. To do this, we introduce deflations, certain\noptimal maps to trees which can be used to obstruct optimal maps between\nsurfaces. Using a smooth version of the orthogeodesic foliation of the first\nauthor and Farre, we also construct many new families of optimal maps, showing\nthat the obstructions coming from deflations are essentially the only ones."}

Under the condition that the number of 3-handles\nequals the rank of the spherical part of the boundary's second homology group,\nwe establish a homological criterion that identifies a geometric basis of\ndisjoint embedded spheres in the boundary corresponding to 3-handle\nattachments, yielding a uniqueness theorem for 3-handle attachments.
