We show that if the exterior of a Brunnian $θ$-curve is atoroidal, then it does not contain an essential annulus. Previously, Ozawa-Tsutsumi showed that there is no essential disc. Consequently, by Thurston's work, the exterior of an atoroidal Brunnian $θ$-curve is hyperbolic with totally geodesic boundary. It follows that Brunnian $θ$-curves of low bridge number have exteriors that are hyperbolic with totally geodesic boundary. We also show that two Brunnian $θ$-curves are isotopic if and only if they are neighborhood isotopic and classify Brunnian spines of genus 2 handlebody knots. We rely heavily on a classification of annuli in the exteriors of genus two handlebody knots by Koda-Ozawa and further developed by Wang in conjunction with sutured manifold theory results of Taylor."}

This is a generalization of G. Castelnuovo, G. Fano, and E.

Recently, it has been revealed that these bounds extend naturally to certain linear syzygies, suggesting the presence of a hierarchical structure governing the quadratic strand of graded Betti numbers.\n  In this article, we establish such a hierarchy in full generality. We first prove sharp upper bounds for $β_{p,1}(X)$ depending on the degree of a projective variety $X$, extending the classical quadratic bounds to all linear syzygies and identifying the extremal varieties in each range. We then introduce geometric conditions that describe how containment of $X$ in low-degree varieties influences syzygies, and we show that these conditions stratify the quadratic strand into a finite sequence of hierarchies. This leads to a complete description of all possible extremal behavior. We also prove a generalized $K_{p,1}$-theorem, demonstrating that the vanishing of $β_{p,1}(X)$ detects containment in a variety of minimal degree at each hierarchy."}
