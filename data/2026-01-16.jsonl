When $p =\\textrm{char}(\\mathbb{F})$ divides the order of $G$, the long-standing problem of computing the induced representation of $G$ on the space $H^0(C,Ω^{\\otimes m}_C)$ of globally holomorphic polydifferentials remains unsolved in general. In this paper, we study the case of the group $G = \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ (where $q$ is a power of~$p$) acting on the Drinfeld curve $C$ which is the projective plane curve given by the equation $XY^q-X^qY-Z^{q+1} = 0$. When $q = p$, we fully decompose $H^0(C,Ω^{\\otimes m}_C)$ as a direct sum of indecomposable $\\mathbb{F}[G]$-modules. For arbitrary $q$, we give a partial decomposition in terms of an explicit $\\mathbb{F}$-basis of $H^0(C,Ω^{\\otimes m}_C)$."}

For an analytic set $X\\subseteq\\mathbb{K}^n$ and a nonzero tangent direction $u\\in T_0X$, we compare the geometric second-order tangent set $T^2_{0,u}X$, defined via second-order expansions of analytic arcs, with the algebraic second-order tangent set $T^{2,a}_{0,u}X$, defined by initial forms of the defining equations. We prove the general inclusion $T^2_{0,u}X\\subseteq T^{2,a}_{0,u}X$ and construct explicit real and complex analytic examples showing that the inclusion is strict.\n  We introduce a second-jet formulation along fixed tangent directions and show that $T^2_{0,u}X=T^{2,a}_{0,u}X$ if and only if the natural second-jet map from analytic arcs in $X$ to jets on the tangent cone $C_0X$ is surjective. This surjectivity is established for smooth analytic germs, homogeneous analytic cones, hypersurfaces with nondegenerate tangent directions, and nondegenerate analytic complete intersections. As an application, we derive second-order necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for $C^2$ optimization problems on analytic sets."}

Under mild conditions satisfied by graph products, we show that stable embeddings into a relatively hierarchically hyperbolic space are exactly those which are quasi-isometrically embedded in the top level hyperbolic space by the orbit map. This shows that graph products of any infinite groups with no isolated vertices are Morse detectable."}
