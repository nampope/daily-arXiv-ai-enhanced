Topaz"], "title": "Reliable Topology for Dynamic Data: Mathematical Foundations and Applications", "comment": null, "summary": "Across many scientific domains, practitioners rely on coarse, discretized summaries to track the evolving structure of complex systems under noise, measurement error, and changing system size. Understanding when such summaries are reliable -- and when apparent robustness is illusory -- remains a fundamental challenge. Topological data analysis (TDA) provides a case study: Crocker diagrams track the number of topological features across spatial scale and time, and because they are computationally efficient and easy to interpret, they have been widely used for exploratory analysis, bifurcation detection, model selection, and parameter inference. Despite their popularity, Crocker diagrams have lacked rigorous stability guarantees ensuring robustness to small data distortions. We develop a conditional stability theory for Crocker diagrams constructed from evolving point clouds. Our main results include deterministic conditions guaranteeing exact invariance when pairwise distances are well separated from the diagram's discretization thresholds, together with bounds on how much the diagrams can change when these conditions fail. We also establish probabilistic stability guarantees under Gaussian noise and bounds on topological change caused by adding or removing points, scaling linearly with the number of modified points. We illustrate these results using two complementary examples: an analytically tractable breathing polygon model that reveals how stability thresholds depend on geometry, and a feasibility analysis of epithelial cell imaging data showing when bounded-change guarantees provide the appropriate robustness framework. Together, these results reveal a two-tier stability structure for coarse, discretized topological summaries: exact invariance under verifiable geometric separation conditions, and geometry-controlled bounded change otherwise."}

Diagnosing such failures is naturally an evaluative problem: given a fixed model and a grounding, can one determine whether they are structurally compatible, and if not, identify the nature and localization of the obstruction?\n  In this work, we introduce a sheaf-theoretic and spectral framework for evaluating structural inconsistency as a \\emph{relative} phenomenon. A model is represented by a cellular sheaf $\\mathcal F$ on a cell complex, together with a morphism into a grounding sheaf $\\mathcal W$ encoding admissible global behavior. Failure of compatibility is captured by the mapping cone of this morphism, whose cohomology computes the relative groups $H^*(K;\\mathcal F,\\mathcal W)$ and separates intrinsic obstructions from inconsistencies induced by the grounding.\n  Beyond exact cohomological classification, we develop \\emph{spectral witnesses} derived from regular and mapping-cone Laplacians. The spectra of these operators provide computable, quantitative indicators of inconsistency, encoding both robustness and spatial localization through spectral gaps, integrated energies, and eigenmode support. These witnesses enable comparison of distinct inconsistency mechanisms in fixed systems without learning, optimization, or modification of the underlying representation.\n  The proposed framework is domain-agnostic and applies to a broad class of structured models where feasibility is enforced locally but evaluated globally."}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "Knotoid theory is a generalization of knot theory introduced by Turaev in 2012. In recent years, various invariants of knotoids have been studied. In this paper, we mainly discuss unknotting moves and unknotting numbers of plus-welded knotoids. Firstly, we prove that a descending diagram of a plus-welded knotoid can be transformed into a trivial one through a finite sequence of $Ω_1$, $VΩ_1 - VΩ_4$, $Ω_v$, $Φ_{\\text{over}}$, and $Φ_+$-moves. Secondly, we extend the warping degree of knots to plus-welded knotoids and discuss its properties. Finally, by utilizing the descending diagram and the warping degree, we obtain two unknotting operations for plus-welded knotoids, referred as a crossing change and a crossing virtualization. For both operations, we find upper bounds for corresponding unknotting numbers of plus-welded knotoids."}

In this note, we show that the knot invariant produced by any XC-structure on the Sweedler algebra is completely determined by the framing of the knot. Furthermore, we also exhibit explicit families of XC-structures on the Sweedler algebra that do not have a ribbon Hopf-algebraic origin."}
