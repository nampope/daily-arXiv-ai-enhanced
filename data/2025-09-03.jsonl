The case of irreducible divisors is completely\ndifferent, and not much is known besides the case of plane curves and a few\nclasses of surfaces. In particular, for plane curves it is a classical result\nthat an irreducible plane curve is Cremona equivalent to a line if and only if\nits log-Kodaira dimension is negative. This can be interpreted as the log\nversion of Castelnuovo's rationality criterion for surfaces. One expects that a\nsimilar result for surfaces in projective space should not be true, as it is\nfalse, the generalization in higher dimensions of Castelnuovo's Rationality\nTheorem. In this paper, the first example of such behaviour is provided,\nexhibiting a rational surface in the projective space with negative log-Kodaira\ndimension, which is not Cremona equivalent to a plane. This can be thought of\nas a sort of log Iskovkikh-Manin, Clemens-Griffith, Artin-Mumford example.\nUsing this example, it is then possible to show that Cremona equivalence to a\nplane is neither open nor closed among log pairs with negative Kodaira\ndimension."}
