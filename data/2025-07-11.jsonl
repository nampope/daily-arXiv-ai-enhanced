We depart from traditional geometric\nspectral analysis, which relies on the Laplace-Beltrami operator and faces\nsignificant computational challenges for Ricci-flat Kahler metrics. Instead, we\nleverage the powerful machinery of Hodge theory, variation of Hodge structures\n(VHS), and arithmetic geometry. We demonstrate how the \"spectral fingerprint\"\nof an algebraic cycle on a K3 surface is encoded in the algebraic coefficients\nof the Picard-Fuchs differential equations that govern the surface's periods.\nFurthermore, this fingerprint is also found in the arithmetic properties of\nthese periods themselves, which frequently manifest as Fourier coefficients of\nautomorphic forms on the moduli space of K3 surfaces. We provide theoretical\nproofs for these foundational claims, grounding the philosophy in established\nmathematical results. Through a preliminary exploration of genus-2 Riemann\nsurfaces, utilizing the Frobenius endomorphism as an \"arithmetic spectral\noperator,\" and a detailed case study of Kummer K3 surfaces, we present concrete\nresults. These results illustrate how algebraic cycles lead to specific,\nalgebraically defined constraints on this \"spectrum,\" thereby offering a new\nperspective on the Hodge Conjecture."}
