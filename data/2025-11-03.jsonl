Partially based on Chapter 3\n  of author's PhD thesis arXiv:2507.09345", "summary": "We prove existence of aCM and Ulrich sheaves respect to ample and globally\ngenerated polarisations on a class of special finite coverings\n$f:X\\to\\mathbb{P}^n$, which in particular contains cyclic ones. In the case of\nrank $2$ on double coverings, we have a precise description of the zero loci of\nsuch sheaves which allows us to study their geometry and classify all possible\nsuch bundles in the case $X$ is regular. We show that on a general double\ncovering of $\\mathbb{P}^3$ branched along a divisor of degree $4,6,8$ all the\nabove sheaves exist and, when stable, we compute the dimension of their\ncomponent in the moduli spaces."}

We then\nuse the existence of free curves to deduce finiteness of the fundamental group\nof the smooth locus in these settings.\n  The paper includes an appendix by de Jong that establishes the K\\\"unneth\nformula for tame \\'etale fundamental groups."}

Leveraging this connection, we\nprovide a new proof of Ito's colored Alexander invariant formula using\ngraphical calculus. Inspired by Anghel's topological model, we derive a formula\ninvolving the Hermitian pairing of fusion trees. This formula verifies that\nnon-semisimple quantum knot invariants can be explicitly encoded via the\nlanguage of fusion trees in the NSS TQC mathematical architecture."}
