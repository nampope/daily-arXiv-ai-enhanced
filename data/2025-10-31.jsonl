The correspondence between\n$I_\\Delta$ and $J_\\nu$ will allow us to translate useful relations from one\nsetting to the other. Second, we want to introduce to the $q$-hypergeometric\ncommunity some possibly new techniques, theory and conjectures arising from\napplications of physical mathematics to geometric topology."}

We construct flat\nmanifolds with the UCC property in all dimensions $ n \\geq 32 $. We also show\nthat the number of distinct commensurability classes containing cusp\ncross-sections with the UCC property is unbounded.

This scattering diagram lives in a\nsubset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and we decompose this subset into three regions,\n$R_{\\Delta},R_{\\Diamond}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{unbdd}}$. The region $R_{\\Delta}$ has\na chamber structure whose chambers are in one-to-one correspondence with strong\nexceptional triples. No ray of the stability scattering diagram enters the\ninterior of such a triangle, replicating a result of Prince, and generalizing a\nresult of Bousseau. The region $R_{\\Diamond}$ is decomposed into diamonds,\nwhich are in one-to-one correspondence with exceptional bundles. Each diamond\nhas a vertical diagonal corresponding to a rank zero object and is traversed by\na dense set of rays. Crucially, however, there are no collisions of rays inside\ndiamonds, making it still possible to control the scattering diagram in\n$R_{\\Diamond}$. Finally, the behaviour of $R_{\\mathrm{unbdd}}$ is chaotic, in\nthat every rational point inside it is a collision of an infinite number of\nrays. We show that the bounded region $R_{\\mathrm{bdd}}= R_{\\Delta}\\cup\nR_{\\Diamond}$ has as upper boundary the Le Potier curve, thus showing that this\ncurve arises naturally through the algorithmic scattering process. We give an\napplication of these results by describing the first wall-crossing for the\nmoduli space of one-dimensional rank zero objects on $\\mathbb{P}^2$.
