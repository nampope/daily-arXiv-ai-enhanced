Comments are welcome", "summary": "In this paper, we introduce and study sequential versions of several fibrewise homotopy invariants, including parametrized topological complexity, parametrized (subspace) homotopic distance. We investigate their basic properties, establish relationships among them, and compare them with the corresponding classical homotopical invariants."}

This suggests that, similarly to the Morse chain complex of a gradient-like vector field, even in the presence of closed orbits, Morse-Smale vector fields admit canonical chain complexes, invariant under topological equivalence, from which one can algebraically derive Morse inequalities. In this paper we show that this is actually the case, improving the state of the art that only offers non-canonical chain complexes. Technically, we achieve this result considering the Čech homology spectral sequence of the unstable manifolds filtration. In particular, we turn bounded exact couples into chain complexes such that the limit page of the spectral sequence associated with an exact couple gives the homology of the chain complex. We showcase our construction with examples."}

Specifically, we show that any dotted-reduced alternating diagram of a knot in a handlebody realizes the minimal crossing number, and that any two such diagrams of the same knot have identical writhe. The proof relies on a generalization of the Jones polynomial to the setting of handlebodies. A stronger version of this result was already proved by Boden, Karimi, and Sikora using a different generalized Jones polynomial; therefore, this text largely expands on one of the main proof tools."}

As a corollary, we show that for reflection groups à la Vinberg, the Vinberg domain is the only invariant properly convex domain if and only if the action is of finite covolume on the Vinberg domain and the dimension is at least 2."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "We show that two properly embedded compact surfaces in an orientable 4-manifold are cobordant if and only if they are $\\mathbb{Z}/2$-homologous and either the 4-manifold has boundary or the surfaces have the same normal Euler number. If the 4-manifold is simply-connected and the surfaces are closed, non-orientable, and cobordant, we show that they are in fact concordant. This completes the classification of closed surfaces in simply-connected 4-manifolds up to concordance. Our methods give new constructions of cobordisms with prescribed boundaries, and completely determine when a given cobordism between the boundaries extends to a cobordism or concordance between the surfaces. We obtain our concordance results by extending Sunukjian's method of ambient surgery to the unoriented case using Pin$^-$-structures. We also discuss conditions for an arbitrary codimension 2 properly embedded submanifold to admit an unoriented spanning manifold with prescribed boundary. All results hold in both the smooth and topological categories."}
