We propose a version of this conjecture in characteristic $p$ and describe its connection to the Batyrev--Manin--Peyre--Tschinkel conjecture over global fields. This is a survey paper written for a volume of the Summer Research Institute in Algebraic Geometry held at Colorado State University in 2025."}

We completely answer this question over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero or larger than the size of the matrix: An $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ admits a nonzero diagonal matrix $D$ such that $A$ and $A+D$ have the same spectrum if and only if, for some size $k$, the $k \\times k$ principal minors of $A$ are not all equal. This relates to the classical additive inverse eigenvalue problem in numerical analysis and has implications for existence and rigidity results in the theory of Floquet isospectrality of discrete periodic operators in solid state physics. The proof employs new techniques involving Hilbert schemes of points and the infinitesimal structure of the Hilbert--Chow morphism."}

We call the resulting complex $\\mathcal{FT}^k_n$ a \\emph{whittled complex} for the Khovanov homology of torus braids. Using this algorithm, we provide a bound for the number of generators at a fixed homological degree in our whittled complex."}

We describe a three stage obstruction theory for the existence of such a 4-manifold, with our main contribution being a `tertiary' obstruction that we describe geometrically via Wall's quadratic self-intersection form."}
