This structure appears naturally when investigating hyperk\\\"ahler\nmanifolds and the symplectic automorphisms acting on them. An important lemma\ndue to Gaberdiel--Hohenegger--Volpato asserts that a Leech pair $(G,S)$ admits\na primitive embedding into the Leech lattice if $rank(S)+\\ell(A_S)\\le 24$.\nHowever, the original proof is incomplete, as demonstrated by a counterexample\ngiven by Marquand and Muller. In this paper, we modify the original approach to\nprovide a complete and conceptual proof of the lemma."}

We prove existence of such\nUlrich bundles, studying their properties, determining conditions for the\nUlrich complexity of their support variety X and analyzing instances of Ulrich\nwildness for X.\n  Our results delve also into the moduli spaces of such Ulrich bundles,\ncharacterizing generic smoothness (and sometimes even birational\nclassification) of their modular components and computing their dimensions.\nThrough a detailed analysis of Chern classes, we also provide understanding of\nthe interplay between the geometric properties of the underlying variety X and\nthe algebro-geometric features of Ulrich bundles on it, contributing to their\nconstruction as well as to their modular and enumerative theory."}

It is known that, if such $F$ exists, then there exists a finitely\ngenerated normal subgroup $K\\trianglelefteq\\pi_1(U)$ such that $\\pi_1(U)/K$ is\nisomorphic to a curve orbifold group $G$ (i.e. the orbifold fundamental group\nof a smooth complex quasi-projective curve endowed with an orbifold structure).\nIn this paper, we address the converse of that statement in the case where the\norbifold Euler characteristic of $G$ is negative, finding a (unique) surjective\nholomorphic map $F:U\\to C$ which realizes the quotient\n$\\pi_1(U)\\twoheadrightarrow \\pi_1(U)/K\\cong G$ at the level of (orbifold)\nfundamental groups. We also prove that our theorem is sharp, meaning that the\nresult does not hold for any curve orbifold group with non-negative orbifold\nEuler characteristic. Furthermore, we apply our main theorem to address Serre's\nquestion of which orbifold fundamental groups of smooth quasi-projective curves\ncan be realized as fundamental groups of complements of curves in\n$\\mathbb{P}^2$."}
