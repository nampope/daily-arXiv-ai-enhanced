The main results show that, for certain spatial handcuff graphs, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the neighborhood equivalence classes of the spatial graphs obtained by tangle replacement and the tangles with which the replacement is performed, up to possibly some permutation. As corollaries, we distinguish handlebody-knots difficult to differentiate with computational invariants and determine their chirality and symmetry groups."}

These can be viewed as a far-reaching generalisation of rotational tangle diagrams for (virtual) upwards tangles, and constitute the topological analogue of XC-algebras, the minimum algebraic structure needed to construct an knot isotopy invariant following the construction of Lawrence and Lee. XC-tangles admit a very natural description in terms of the so-called XC-Gauss diagrams, and this equivalence lifts the well-known equivalence between virtual upwards tangles and upwards Gauss diagrams. For every XC-algebra $A$, there is a naturally defined strict monoidal full functor $Z_A: \\mathcal{T}^{\\mathrm{XC}} \\rightarrow v\\mathcal{E}(A)$ from the category of XC-tangles to the \"virtual category of elements of $A$\". When $A$ is the endomorphism algebra of a finite-dimensional representation of a ribbon Hopf algebra, this functor can be viewed as an extension of the corresponding Reshetikhin-Turaev functor. Lastly, we also initiate the study of a theory of finite type invariants for one-component XC-tangles that lifts that for virtual long knots."}

We take the set of base points $B$ to be the set of rings on the form $\\enm_{\\mathbb Z}(M)$ where $M$ is a simple right $A$-module for some associative ring $A.$ The set of base-points in the associative ring $A$ is defined as $\\pts_B(A)=\\{\\mor_{\\cat{Rings}}(A,\\enm_{\\mathbb Z}(M))\\}.$ For any finite subset $M\\subseteq\\pts_B(A)$ we prove that the localizing ring $A_M$ exists. and so the construction from arXiv:2511.04191 gives a definition of schemes of associative algebras. Defining a topology on $\\pts_B(A)$ such that when $A$ is commutative it is the Zariski topology, we get the ordinary definition of schemes when we consider the category of commutative rings.

We obtain a bound on the degree of general leaves of foliations of general type, which is linear in $g$. To achieve this we study the birational geometry of foliations within the framework of the Minimal Model Program (MMP). Extending the approach of Spicer--Svaldi and Pereira--Svaldi, we study the set of pseudo-effective thresholds of adjoint foliated structures, showing that it satisfies the descending chain condition and it admits an explicit universal lower bound. These results yield effective birationality statements for adjoint divisors of the form $K_{\\mathcal{F}} + τK_X$."}

This provides the first example of a family of (pointwise) COHAs defined over the space of stability conditions."}
