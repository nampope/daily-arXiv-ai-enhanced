Here, continuous six-functor formalisms are those valued in\ndualizable presentable stable $\\infty$-categories and satisfying canonical\ndescent, profinite descent, and hyperdescent. As an application, we generalize\nEfimov's computation of the algebraic $K$-theory of sheaves to all localizing\ninvariants on continuous six-functor formalisms. Our results show that\nlocalizing invariants behave analogously to compactly supported sheaf\ncohomology theories when evaluated on continuous six-functor formalisms on\nlocally compact Hausdorff spaces."}

An important\nrule of arc presentations is that different arcs must be placed on separate\npages. In 1999, Dynnikov proposed a three-page presentation that bends this\nrule by restricting the total number of pages to three. Dynnikov showed that\nevery link admits a three-page presentation. In this paper, we provide an\nalternative proof of this result. Also we define the three-page index\n$\\alpha_3(L)$ of a link $L$ that the minimum number of arcs needed to represent\n$L$ in a three-page presentation. We examine three-page presentations for torus\nlinks, leading to the determination of the exact three-page indices for several\ntorus links."}
