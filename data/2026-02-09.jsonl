First, we find a family of twisted knots with arc shift number $n$ for any given $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Then we define a new unknotting operation, called the region arc shift move for twisted knots and find family of twisted knots whose region arc shift number is less than or equal to $n$ for any given $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Later, we explore bounds for region arc shift number and forbidden number."}

We consider the cases of 1-fares and 2-fares, provide examples to show that the enhancements are proper and end with some open questions about the cases of n-fares for n > 2."}
