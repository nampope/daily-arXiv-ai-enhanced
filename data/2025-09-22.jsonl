We make this connection explicit, with the following\noutcome: if $B$ is the full Burau matrix of any braid, and $A$ is any square\nsubmatrix of $B - \\lambda I$, we define a Heegaard Floer homology theory that\ncategorifies $\\det(A)$ and is an invariant of the braid. We also describe an\nanalogous construction for the Gassner representation. Then, we leverage the\nrelationship between the Burau representation and quantum $\\mathfrak{gl}(1\n\\vert 1)$ to exhibit connections between the latter and Heegaard Floer\nhomology. We associate a bordered sutured Heegaard Floer homology group to any\ntangle, and give a simple, geometric proof that our invariant recovers the\n$U_q(\\mathfrak{gl}(1 \\vert 1))$ braid representation."}
