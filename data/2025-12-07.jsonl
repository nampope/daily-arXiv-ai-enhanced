These collections are useful for neural network latent space configuration and training. For classification problem with large or unknown number of classes this allows to construct classifiers without classification layer and extend the number of classes without retraining of network from the very beginning. The construction allows to create large well-spaced vector collections in spaces of minimal possible dimension. If the number of classes is known or approximately predictable, one can choose sufficient enough vector collection size. If one needs to significantly extend the number of classes, one can extend the collection in the same latent space, or to incorporate the collection into collection of higher dimensions with same spacing between vectors. Also, regular symmetric structure of constructed vector collections can significantly simplify problems of search for nearest cluster centers or embeddings in the latent space. Construction of vector collections is based on combinatorics and geometry of semi-simple Lie groups irreducible representations with highest weight."}

They allow the study of the derived category of a singular variety $X$ via a triangulated category that behaves like the derived category of a smooth variety.\n  We follow these ideas to study the bounded derived category of a singular, reduced curve $C$ (with arbitrary singularities and number of components). We start by describing an explicit categorical resolution of singularities, specializing a general construction of Kuznetsov and Lunts. We prove the existence of Bridgeland stability conditions on these categories. As a consequence, we get the existence of proper, good moduli spaces of semistable objects. If the curve $C$ is irreducible, then we relate these moduli spaces to the moduli of slope-semistable torsion-free sheaves on $C$, and to the moduli of slope-semistable vector bundles on the (geometric) resolution $\\tilde{C}$. This extends classical constructions by Oda and Seshadri, Bhosle and many others.\n  Finally, we use these results to give explicit descriptions of the moduli of torsion-free sheaves on a curve with a single node, cusp, or tacnode."}

Shepherd-Barron"], "title": "A non-linear differential equation for the periods of elliptic surfaces", "comment": null, "summary": "Suppose that $f:X\\to C$ is a general Jacobian elliptic surface over the complex numbers. Then the primitive cohomology $H^{1,1}_{prim}(X)$ has, up to a sign, a natural orthonormal basis $(η_i)_{i\\in [1, N]}$ given by certain meromorphic $2$-forms $η_i$ of the second kind, one for each ramification point of the classifying morphism $φ$ from $C$ to the stack of generalized elliptic curves. (Here $N$ is any one of $h^{1,1}_{prim}(X)$, the number of moduli of $X$ and the degree of the ramification of $φ$; these numbers are equal.) A choice of local co-ordinate on the stack of elliptic curves provides, via the branch locus of $φ$, an {é}tale local co-ordinate system $(t_i)_{i\\in [1, N]}$ on the stack of Jacobian elliptic surfaces.\n  The main result here is that truncation of the Gauss--Manin connexion yields the system $$\\{\\partial_i H=(\\partial_i η_i\\wedgeη_i)H\\}_{i\\in [1, N]}$$ of non-linear pde satisfied by $H=[η_1,\\ldots, η_N]$, where $\\partial_i =\\partial/\\partial t_i$ and the skew tensor $\\partial_i η_i\\wedgeη_i$ of rank $2$ is the ecliptic of $η_i$ (the plane in which the particle $η_i$ is instantaneously moving with respect to $t_i$). Moreover, after rigidification of the integral cohomology, $H$ can be interpreted as providing a period map for these surfaces with values in the complex orthogonal group $O_N$, and we prove a generic infinitesimal Torelli theorem for this map. For rational elliptic surfaces this can be calculated explicitly."}

Our method is based on the G-minimal model program for surfaces and on the Sarkisov link factorisation of birational maps between Mori fibre spaces. We characterise rationality of surfaces, and in certain cases, birationality between surfaces in terms of the pieces of these decompositions, which we call atoms."}
