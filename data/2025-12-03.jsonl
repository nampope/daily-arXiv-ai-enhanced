In particular, for any big divisor $D$ on $X_{\\overlineη}$, we can run the anticanonical MMP and $D$-MMP with scaling of an ample divisor on $X_{\\overlineη}$."}

Our model differs from manifold-based models in that singular points of a 3D continuum, i.e., boundary points where the tangent plane is not uniquely defined, are treated not as anomalies but as a central subject of our theoretical investigation. We characterize the local and global topology of Yin sets. Then we give a unique boundary representation of Yin sets based on the notion of a glued surface, a quotient space of an orientable compact 2-manifold along a one-dimensional CW complex. Our results apply to 3D continua with arbitrarily complex topology and may be useful in a number of scientific and engineering applications such as solid modeling, computer-aided design, and numerical simulations of multiphase flows with topological changes."}

To this end, we introduce a localized version of Gromov's distortion for any closed path-connected subset of $\\R^n$. If two such sets have local Gromov distortion below a universal dimension-dependent constant $g_n$ at some scale, and if their Hausdorff-distance is less than one quarter of that scale, we can show that the fundamental groups of their complements are isomorphic. In addition, we construct this isomorphism so that it restricts to the corresponding peripheral subgroups as an isomorphism as well.\n  Applied to the images of one-dimensional knots it follows that two knots are equivalent if their Hausdorff-distance is bounded in terms of the scale under which their local Gromov distortion is controlled. From that we deduce novel stability results for knot equivalence in the Lipschitz category, and in the setting of fractional Sobolev regularity below $C^1$. Moreover, we prove a compactness theorem of knot equivalence classes with respect to weak $W^{3/2,2}$-convergence.\n  As an application we show that the Möbius energy introduced by O'Hara~\\cite{ohara_1991a} can be minimized within arbitrary prime knot classes under a symmetry constraint, and that these minimizers are in fact critical points and therefore smooth and even real analytic. In particular, in every torus knot class there are at least two distinct critical knots for the Möbius energy."}

We prove that any cycle of this type in the graph of an ideal right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope corresponds to a hyperbolic link such that its complement consists of $4$-copies of this polytope glued according to its checkerboard coloring. Moreover, this link consists of trivially embedded circles bijectively corresponding to the vertices of the polytope. For such cycles we prove that the $3$-antiprism $A(3)$ (octahedron) has exactly $2$ combinatorially different cycles, the $4$-antiprism $A(4)$ has exactly $7$ combinatorially different cycles, and these cycles correspond to $7$ cycles (perhaps combinatorially equivalent) on any polytope different from antiprisms, and any antiprism $A(k)$ has at least $2$ combinatorially different cycles. The $2$-fold branched covering space corresponding to our link is a small cover over some simple $3$-polytope. This small cover is defined by a Hamiltonian cycle on it. We show that any compact hyperbolic $3$-polytope with a Hamiltonian cycle arises in this way."}
