The Ehrenpreis Conjecture (proved by Kahn-Markovic) asserts that for any $ε>0$ there are finite covers $M_ε\\to M$, and $N_ε\\to N$, such that the Teichmuller distance (in the suitable moduli space) between $M_ε$ and $N_ε$ is less than $ε$. It is natural to ask how large the degrees of these coverings need to be to achieve that the distance between $M_ε$ and $N_ε$ is less than $ε$. In this paper we show that there exists a constant $k>0$, depending only on $M$ and $N$, so that the covers $M_ε\\to M$, and $N_ε\\to N$, can be chosen to have the degrees less than $ε^{-k}$. We show that this bound is optimal by considering the case when $M$ and $N$ are arithmetic Riemann surfaces with the same invariant trace field which are not commensurable to each other."}

The mapping class groups of these types of surfaces are not countably generated. However, they are Polish groups, so they can be topologically countably generated. This paper focuses on finding minimal topological generating sets of involutions for $\\mathrm{Map}(S(n))$. We establish that for $n \\geq 16$, $\\mathrm{Map}(S(n))$ can be topologically generated by four involutions. Furthermore, we establish that the the mapping class groups of the Loch Ness Monster surface ($n=1$) and the Jacob's Ladder surface ($n=2$) can be topologically generated by three involutions."}

In this paper, we generalize the construction to include multiple tangle regions. The constructed knot $K$ with a partial knot $\\hat{K}$ and multiple tangle regions satisfies the following two properties: its Alexander polynomial is the product of the Alexander polynomials of the numerators of these tangles and the square of the Alexander polynomial of the partial knot $\\hat{K}$, and there exists a surjective homomorphism from the knot group of $K$ to that of $\\hat{K}$ which maps the longitude of $K$ to the trivial element."}

One was introduced by Erlandsson and Fanoni, and the other by Mahan Mj. These graphs were developed independently in different contexts. In this paper, we provide explicit formulae for computing their quasi-flat ranks. These formulae depend on the genus and the number of boundary components of the underlying surface, as well as the interpolation parameter. We also classify geometries of the interpolating graphs into the hyperbolic, relatively hyperbolic, and thick cases. Our approach relies on the theory of twist-free graphs of multicurves, which is developed by Vokes and Russel."}

In this paper, we study their geometric properties and show that they behave like universally deformed Nakajima quiver varieties. Based on this, we provide a new proof of the existence of critical stable envelopes on them. Following an idea of Nakajima, we give a sheaf theoretic interpretation of critical stable envelopes by the hyperbolic restriction in the affinization of symmetric quiver varieties. The associativity of hyperbolic restrictions implies the triangle lemma of critical stable envelopes."}

The second purpose is to show that the $\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_p$-fibers of the special Newton polygon map behave like formal schemes, and in particular, satisfy henselianity properties with respect to their reduced locus. These two goals achieved in this article are two of the crucial ingredients used in our collaboration with Hamman, Ivanov, Lourenço and Zou to construct the equivalence that compares the schematic and analytic local Langlands categories of Zhu and of Fargues--Scholze. To achieve these goals, we introduce and study spatial kimberlites, which is a better behaved variant of the theory previously developed by the author."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We develop a framework to study the K-stability of weighted Fano hypersurfaces based on a combination of birational and convex-geometric techniques. As an application, we prove that all quasi-smooth weighted Fano hypersurfaces of index 1 with at most two weights greater than 1 are K-stable. We also construct several examples of K-unstable quasi-smooth weighted Fano hypersurfaces of low indices. To prove these results, we establish lower bounds for stability thresholds using the method of Abban-Zhuang, which reduces the problem to lower-dimensional cases. A key feature of our approach is the use of plt flags that are not necessarily admissible."}

In particular, this confirms Ruan's cohomological Hilbert-Chow crepant resolution conjecture. The proof exploits Fulton-MacPherson compactifications, reducing the conjecture to the case of the affine plane. As an application, using previous results of the author, we also deduce the families DT/GW correspondence for threefolds $S \\times C$ in classes that are zero on the first factor, yielding a wall-crossing proof of the correspondence in this case. Finally, we speculate on the relationship between Hilbert schemes and Fulton-MacPherson compactifications beyond the topics considered in this work."}
