In order to do so,\nwe show how to construct a uniformizing variation of Hodge structure from a\nslope zero tensor and vice versa. As a consequence, we generalize various\nuniformization results of Catanese and Di Scala to the singular setting. For\nexample, we prove that $X$ is a quotient of a bounded symmetric domain of tube\ntype by a group acting properly discontinuously and freely in codimension one\nif and only if $X$ admits a slope zero tensor. As a key step in the proof, we\nestablish the compactness of the holonomy group of the singular\nK\\\"{a}hler--Einstein metric on $X_{\\mathrm{reg}}$."}
