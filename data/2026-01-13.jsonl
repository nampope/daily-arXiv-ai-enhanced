This family generalizes both Ozsváth and Szabó's $n$- and $1/n$-surgery exact triangles for positive integers $n$ and the author's recent 2-surgery exact triangle to all positive rational slopes.\n  The construction reduces to a combinatorial problem that involves triangle and quadrilateral counting maps in a genus 1 Heegaard diagram. The main contribution of this paper is solving this combinatorial problem, which is particularly tricky for slopes $r\\neq n,1/n$; one key idea is to use an involution that is closely related to the ${\\rm Spin}^{c}$ conjugation symmetry."}

This also comes from construction of explicit real algebraic maps onto explicit regions in real affine spaces on real algebraic manifolds. More generally, we are interested in difficulty in explicit construction of real algebraic objects, where existence and approximation has been well-known, since pioneering studies by Nash and Tognoli, in the latter half of 20th century. This also comes from interest in singularity theory of differentiable, smooth or real algebraic functions and maps, especially, explicit construction."}

For representations produced by embedding Fuchsian representations into higher rank Lie groups, these domains are known to admit fiber bundle structures and the structure group is $\\operatorname{SO}(2)$. In this article, we determine the equivariant diffeomorphism type of the fiber for these bundles when the domain lives inside a $3$-dimensional complex flag variety. In order to do so, we explicitly work out a smooth version of Fintushel's classification theorem for smooth $S^1$-actions on $4$-manifolds. We show that, in each case, the action on the fiber is equivalent to a circle action on a Hirzebruch surface (or an equivariant connected sum of such actions)."}

The proof is based on our earlier work on the Chern-Dold character in complex cobordism theory and leads to a new derivation of the Lagrange inversion formula. We provide a similar interpretation of the multiplicative inversion formulas in terms of Chern numbers of the smooth theta divisors. We discuss also the general related problem when all Chern numbers of an algebraic variety are divisible by its Euler characteristic."}

Pro-étale motives naturally enhance to a condensed category and we show that their solidification is very close to the category of solid sheaves defined by Fargues-Scholze, suitably modified to work on schemes: this is a rigidity result. As a consequence, we obtain that in contrast with the rigid-analytic setting, solid sheaves on schemes afford the six operations, and we obtain a solid realization functor of motives, extending the $\\ell$-adic realization functor.

We generalize this, replacing the zero section in the cotangent bundle to M by certain singular Lagrangians.\n  First, we introduce Q-diagrams in threefolds. They are collections Q of smooth cooriented surfaces, intersecting transversally everywhere but in a finite set of quadruple crossing points. We require that shifting any surface of the collection from such a point in the direction of its coorientation creates a simplex with the cooriented out faces. The Q-diagrams are 3d analogs of bipartite ribbon graphs.\n  Let L be the Lagrangian in the cotangent bundle to M given by the union of the zero section and the conormal bundles to the cooriented surfaces of Q. Let X(L) be the stack of admissible dg-sheaves on M with the microlocal support in L, whose microlocalization at the conormal bundle to each cooriented surface of Q is a rank one local system.\n  We introduce the boundary dL of L. It is a singular Lagrangian in a symplectic space, providing a symplectic stack X(dL), and a restriction functor from X(L) to X(dL). The image of the latter is Lagrangian. We show that, under mild conditions on Q, this Lagrangian has a cluster description, and so it is a K_2-Lagrangian. It also has a simple description in the non-commutative setting."}
