This is a higher Chow analogue of Huybrechts' conjecture on the\nsymplectic action on $0$-cycles. We give several partial results verifying our\nconjecture, some conditional and some unconditional. Our unconditional results\ninclude the full proof for Kummer surfaces of product type."}

However, unlike for rational points, it is conjectured\nthat this obstruction is the only one; early versions of this conjecture date\nback to work of Colliot-Th\\'el\\`ene and Sansuc (1981) and of Kato and Saito\n(1986). In this paper, we provide evidence for this when $X$ is the\nself-product of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication. For some\nvarieties of this form, we construct infinitely many extensions $L/K$ for which\nthe base change $X\\times_K \\mathrm{Spec}\\ L$ satisfies a local-to-global\nprinciple for a fixed prime $p$. We do this via explicitly constructing global\nzero-cycles, and our results have applications over all but two of the complex\nmultiplication fields."}

Gaiotto, G. Moore and E. Witten [1506.04087] and the theory of\nsecondary polytopes introduced in the 1990s in the study of higher-dimensional\ndiscriminants.\n  It also summarizes subsequent work with L. Soukhanov [2011.00845] where the\ntunneling data were observed to be similar to linear algebra data describing\nperverse sheaves on the complex plane except that in the physical context\nvector spaces are replaced by triangulated categories. The relevant concept\nhere is that of perverse schobers, which are conjectural categorical analogs of\nperverse sheaves proposed by M. Kapranov and V. Schechtman [1411.2772].\n  Finally, we sketch a research program of extending these ideas to\n$4$-dimensional theories and the resurgence formalism."}

Singul., 2021]. As a key step, we generalize the Thom-Milnor bound to\npolynomial maps on a nonsingular real algebraic variety, improving the\ndependence on the degree. Finally, inspired by the work of B\\\"{u}rgisser,\nCucker and Tonelli-Cueto [Found. Comput. Math., 2020], we introduce a condition\nnumber for families of functions. Using this we extend existing bounds due to\nBasu, Pollack and Roy [Proc. Amer. Math.
