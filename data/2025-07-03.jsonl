As an important result, we have shown that the\nsheaf of modules made of Glueing schemes and Glueing linked sheaves of modules\nis a linked sheaf. Also, it has been shown that for every sheaf of modules on\nnon-domain, it is possible to obtain a maximal linked subsheaf of modules."}

It is quite often the case that the geometric information concerning\nthe jet schemes of an algebraic variety can be described, but the more refined\nalgebraic information is quite mysterious. For example, it is known that\ncomputing the Hilbert function associated to a natural grading on these jet\nschemes is a very hard problem. The present paper handles a few such\ncomputations. It succeeds in computing the Hilbert functions of the second\norder jet schemes in the case of maximal minors of a $2\\times n$ matrix."}
