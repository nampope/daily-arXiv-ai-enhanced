The theorem is motivated by recent conjectures and their proof strategy by Gao and Zhang on the Northcott property of the Beilinson--Bloch height pairing. Our method involves a homological algebra interpretation of the Archimedean height by Hain. This interpretation allows us to introduce motivic viewpoints using Deligne cohomology, cycle class maps and higher Chow groups.\n  Especially, we compare the biextension by Hain and Brosnan--Pearlstein over $\\mathbb{C}$ based on Poincaré line bundle and Hodge theory with the $\\mathbb{G}_{\\mathrm{m}}$-biextension of Bloch and Seibold defined by two families of homologically trivial cycles on a generically smooth family of projective varieties over a smooth curve. Our comparison, a relative version of the work of Gorchinskiy, enhances his derived viewpoint on these biextensions. Especially when the family of varieties are smooth, the two constructions are related via derived regulator maps to Deligne cohomology, reinterpreted similarly to Beilinson's absolute Hodge cohomology, as well as the derived description of Hardouin's biextension that generalizes Poincaré line bundle by Hain. The comparison when the family defined over a smooth curve has a strongly semistable reduction further involves a simple monodromy computation using mixed Hodge modules.\n  Along our discussion, we simplify the discussion of Bloch and Seibold, partly in the style of Gorchinskiy. For example, the symmetry of their biextension is proved more easily than their work."}

This invariant turns out to be equivalent to an infinite cyclic version of the Carter-Silver-Williams (CSW) polynomial. The importance of the CSW polynomial is that half its symplectic rank gives strong lower bounds on the virtual genus. Recall that the virtual genus of a virtual link $J$ is the smallest genus of all closed orientable surfaces $Σ$ on which $J$ can be represented by a link diagram on $Σ$. Here we generalize the CSW lower bound to all quantum supergroups $U_q(\\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ with $m,n>0$. For $(m,n)=(1,1)$, the $U_q(\\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ bound is the same as the CSW bound. However, changing the value of the pair $(m,n)$ can give lower bounds better than those available from other known methods. We compare the $U_q(\\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ lower bounds to those coming from the CSW polynomial, the surface bracket, the arrow polynomial, hyperbolicity, and the Gordon-Litherland determinant test. As a first application, we show that the Seifert genus of homologically trivial knots in thickened surfaces is not additive under the connected sum operation of virtual knots. As a second application, we prove that the Jaeger-Kauffman-Saleur invariant of a virtual knot is always realizable as the Alexander polynomial of an infinite cyclic cover of a knot complement in some $Σ\\times [0,1]$, but is not always so on a surface of minimal genus. This is accomplished with a generalization of the $Zh$-construction, called the homotopy $Zh$-construction."}

We also show that equivariant tubular neighborhoods of 1-dimensional fixed-point sets, when they exist, are not unique, in contrast to the nonequivariant case. Our results combine with earlier work to provide a classification of all locally linear involutions on S^4. As a further application, we obtain that strongly negative amphichiral knots with trivial Alexander polynomial are equivariantly topologically slice with respect to the linear action, strengthening a previous result of the first two authors.
