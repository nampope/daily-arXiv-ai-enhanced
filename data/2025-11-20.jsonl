We demonstrate that if $Γ$ is an infinite graph with finitely many ends, and $g \\colon Γ\\to Γ$ is end-periodic, then its mapping torus $Z_g$ admits a flowline-preserving homotopy equivalence with a finite 2-complex. With additional hypotheses on $g$, this compactified mapping torus subsequently embeds in the mapping torus of a homotopy equivalence on a finite-rank graph via a $π_1$-injective, flow-preserving map. We prove that every mapping class of $Γ$ arising from an end-periodic homotopy equivalence contains a representative whose mapping torus realizes such an embedding."}

Our first theorem proves that degenerations of toric pairs are finite quotients of toric pairs. In a similar vein, under some mild conditions, we prove that degenerations of cluster type pairs are finite quotients of cluster type pairs. Then, we focus on degenerations of cluster type surfaces. We give some general criteria for the existence of $1$-complements on degenerations of toric surfaces. We prove that for almost all $(a,b,c)\\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 1}^3$ the weighted projective plane $\\mathbb{P}(a,b,c)$ has no non-trivial degenerations. In particular, for a Markov triple $(a,b,c)\\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 2}^3$, we prove that $\\mathbb{P}(a^2,b^2,c^2)$ admits no non-trivial degenerations. Finally, we give a complete classification of the degenerations of $\\mathbb{P}(1,1,n)$ for $n\\geq 3$."}

This is a consequence of the Corson-Trace characterization of diagrammatic reducibility. In this paper we use a Corson-Trace like characterization of diagrammatic reducibility away from a subcomplex to obtain a considerable stronger result. We apply this to the question of local indicability in the context of Whitehead's asphericity conjecture. We show that an injective labeled oriented tree (LOT) that is diagrammatically reducible of degree 2, and all its quotients are as well, is locally indicable."}

By the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality, these manifolds do not admit Einstein metrics. As a further consequence of our construction, we show that every closed aspherical 3-manifold with amenable fundamental group is virtually the $π_1$-injective boundary of an aspherical 4-manifold with vanishing Euler characteristic and vanishing simplicial volume, thereby answering questions of Edmonds and of Löh-Moraschini-Raptis up to finite covers."}
