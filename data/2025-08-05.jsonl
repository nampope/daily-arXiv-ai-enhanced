In\nthis paper we give several consequences of the\nSegre-Harbourne-Gimigliano-Hirschowitz Conjecture, that pertain to complete\nlinear systems on $X_n$. We begin by classifying such systems $|C|$ with\ngeneral irreducible member of genus $g \\geq 2$ (up to Cremona equivalence), in\nterms of invariants of the adjoint systems $|C+mK|$. We then use this to prove\nthat, for fixed $n \\geq 10$ and $g\\geq 2$, up to the action of the Cremona\ngroup, there exist finitely many complete linear systems on $X_n$ whose general\nmember is irreducible of genus $g$. Further, there is a function $g\\mapsto\nn(g)$ such that every such (effective) system is Cremona equivalent to a system\nin $X_{n(g)}$. The latter result is based on the explicit computation of the\nminimum possible self-intersection of an irreducible linear system with given\n$n$ and $\\dim(|C|)$. We classify those systems which achieve the minimal\nself-intersection. We also classify the systems with $C^2 \\leq 5$, whether or\nnot they have minimal $C^2$ for the given $n$ and dimension. We finish by\nproving several statements concerning systems that are base-point-free, and\nsystems that give birational maps to their image."}

Instead of treating supermanifolds as\nsets of points, we adopt an algebraic-geometric perspective, emphasizing the\nalgebra of functions and utilizing the framework of ringed spaces and sheaf\ntheory. We begin by constructing presheaves and sheaves to define locally\nringed spaces, which model the local structure of supermanifolds.\nSuperfunctions, a key element, are shown to differ significantly from ordinary\nfunctions, leading to a richer structure. We also prove a key characterization\ntheorem for morphisms between supermanifolds and demonstrate that the category\nof supermanifolds admits finite products.
