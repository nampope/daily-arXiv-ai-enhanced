We then show that for tensors in $S^d\\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ with $d$\neven, low enough regularity can reduce finding a symmetric tensor decomposition\nto solving a system of linear equations. For order-$4$ tensors we prove that\ngeneric tensors of rank up to $r=2n+1$ can be decomposed efficiently via moment\nmatrix extension, exceeding the rank threshold allowed by simultaneous\ndiagonalization.
