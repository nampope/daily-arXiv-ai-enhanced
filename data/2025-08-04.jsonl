Determining the extent of this island is a hard\nproblem. If $M$ is geometrically finite and its convex core boundary is pleated\nonly along simple closed curves, then we cut up its conformal boundary in a way\ngoverned by the pleating combinatorics to produce a fundamental domain for $\n\\pi_1(M) $ that is combinatorially stable under small deformations, even those\nwhich change the pleated structure. We give a computable region in $X$, cut out\nby polynomial inequalities over $\\mathbb{R}$, within which this fundamental\ndomain is valid: all the groups in the region have peripheral structures that\nlook `coarsely similar', in that they come from real-algebraically deforming a\nfixed conformal polygon and its side-pairings.
