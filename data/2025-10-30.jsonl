Assuming that there is\nonly one moving singularity and that its image in the Frobenius pullback of the\nfibration has degree one over the base, we provide a complete classification up\nto birational equivalence. This relies on an in-depth analysis of the generic\nfibres, whose geometry we describe explicitly. We prove that these fibrations\nare covered by elliptic fibrations, and that the covers are birational on the\nfibres but purely inseparable of exponent one on the bases."}

Any classical generator is a\ngenerator, but not vice versa. We discuss a simple algebro-geometric example of\na non-classical generator in the derived category of coherent sheaves on any\nsmooth proper curve of genus $g \\geq 2$.
