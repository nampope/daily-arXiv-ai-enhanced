First, we give a complete classification of when a graph \\(n\\)-braid group is free, using only cubical methods and without appealing to discrete Morse theory.\n  We then focus on graph \\(2\\)-braid groups and study the square complex \\(UD_2(\\graf)\\), which is special in the sense of Haglund--Wise, via its maximal product subcomplexes and intersection complex introduced in \\cite{Oh22}. Under natural connectivity and embeddedness assumptions, we show that the union \\(UP_2(\\graf)\\) of maximal product subcomplexes of \\(UD_2(\\graf)\\) captures essential quasi-isometry information of \\(\\bbB_2(\\graf)\\), the fundamental group of \\(UD_2(\\graf)\\).\n  Applying this framework to an infinite family of graphs, we obtain infinitely many graph \\(2\\)-braid groups that are quasi-isometric to right-angled Artin groups and infinitely many that are not, extending the examples of \\cite{Oh22}, and we indicate new phenomena in relative hyperbolicity."}

Bjerkevik conjectures that this distance is Lipschitz equivalent to the classical interleaving distance on modules of a bounded pointwise dimension. In this article, we establish a Lipschitz equivalence with respect to the bottleneck distance for upset-decomposable persistence modules. In particular, this proves half of Bjerkevik's conjecture for these modules. More precisely, we bound the bottleneck distance by a multiple of the pruning distance, improving the conjectured bound from~$2r$ to~$(2r-1)$ where~$r$ is the maximal pointwise dimension, and show that this improved bound is sharp. We also prove the converse inequality, bounding the pruning distance by the bottleneck distance. Our approach relies on explicitly computing the pruning of upset-decomposable modules, which we carry out using a directed graph formalism."}

Baêta", "Xiaxing Cai"], "title": "Chord Sobolev inequalities", "comment": "This paper is one of two papers split from arXiv:2511.12866. This paper focuses on Euclidean chord Sobolev inequalities and their limiting cases, while the updated preprint arXiv:2511.12866 (already online) focuses on the affine version. After the update, there is only minor overlap between the two papers", "summary": "The paper establishes a new family of analytic inequalities. Together with the fractional Sobolev inequalities of Almgren and Lieb, they form a complete class of analytic inequalities, referred to as the chord Sobolev inequalities. The paper also demonstrates the connection of all these inequalities to the chord isoperimetric inequalities in integral geometry. The limiting cases of the chord Sobolev inequalities are derived as well, one of which can be viewed as a logarithmic Sobolev-type inequality. These limiting cases, combined with the work of Bourgain, Brezis and Mironescu, complete the theory of chord Sobolev inequalities."}

The proof is compilative and relies on results obtained by many researchers on the approximability of almost-surjective almost-isometries by linear surjective isometries. In the finite-dimensional case, previously obtained by I.~Mikhailov, a simpler proof under weaker assumptions is given. In the finite-dimensional case, a criterion for isometry in terms of finite (compact) subsets is also given."}
