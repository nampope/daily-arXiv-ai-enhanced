In this paper, we\ninvestigate properties of the inf invariant and its associated optimal metric.\nStarting from a filling curve and a separating curve, we construct a two\ninteger parameter family of curves for which we derive coarse length bounds and\nqualitative properties of their associated optimal metrics. In particular, we\nshow that there are infinitely many pairs of filling curves, each pair having\ndistinct $\\text{inf}$ invariants but the same self-intersection number.\n  The inf invariants give rise to a natural spectrum, we call the inf spectrum,\nassociated to the moduli space of the surface.

We then describe the\ncorresponding index homomorphism of even K-groups in terms of spectral\nlocalizers. This means that our explicit formula for the index homomorphism\ndoes not depend on the full spectrum of the abstract Dirac operator D, but\nrather on the intersection between this spectrum and a compact interval. The\nsize of this compact interval does however reflect the interplay between the\nK-theoretic input and the abstract Dirac operator. Since the spectral\nprojections for D are not available in the general context of Hilbert\n$C^*$-modules we instead rely on certain continuous compactly supported\nfunctions applied to D to construct the spectral localizer.
