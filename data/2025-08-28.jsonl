We\nprovide here the computations of $\\mathcal{O}_f(f)$ for a special class of\nfunctions $f\\in\\mathcal{C}^{\\infty}(K)$ on the Klein bottle $K$ having the\nfollowing properties: (i) at each critical point $f$ is smoothly equivalent to\nsome homogeneous polynomial (e.g. $f$ is Morse), and (ii) there is a regular\nconnected component $\\alpha$ of a level set of $f$ such that $K\\setminus\\alpha$\nis a disjoint union of two open M\\\"obius bands, with closures $M_1$ and $M_2$.\nLet $f_i = f|_{M_i}$ be the restriction of $f$ to the M\\\"{o}bius band $M_i$,\n$i=1,2$, and $\\mathcal{O}_{f_i}(f_i)$ be the path component of $f_i$ in its\norbit with respect to the above action of $\\mathcal{D}(M_i)$. The possible\nhomotopy types of $\\mathcal{O}_{f_i}(f_i)$ are explicitly computed earlier.

Recent works have shown that cross-subspace alignment (CSA)\ncodes constructed from algebraic geometry (AG) codes on high-genus curves can\nimprove PIR rates over classical constructions. In this paper, we propose a new\nPIR scheme based on AG codes from the Hermitian curve, a well-known example of\nan $F_\\ell$-maximal curve, that is, a curve defined over the finite field with\n$\\ell$ elements which attains the Hasse-Weil upper bound on the number of its\n$F_\\ell$-rational points. The large number of rational points enables longer\ncode constructions, leading to higher retrieval rates than schemes based on\ngenus 0, genus 1, and hyperelliptic curves of arbitrary genus. Our results\nhighlight the potential of maximal curves as a natural source of efficient PIR\nconstructions."}

We\ndevelop their general theory and pursue their relation with categories of\nD-modules. In particular, we establish the functorial properties of limit\ncategories such as the smooth pull-back and projective push-forward. Using the\nnotion of limit categories, we propose a precise formulation of the Dolbeault\ngeometric Langlands conjecture, proposed by Donagi-Pantev as the classical\nlimit of the de Rham geometric Langlands equivalence. It states an equivalence\nbetween the derived categories of moduli stacks of semistable Higgs bundles and\nlimit categories of moduli stacks of all Higgs bundles. We prove the existence\nof a semiorthogonal decomposition of the limit category into quasi-BPS\ncategories, which are categorical versions of BPS invariants on a non-compact\nCalabi-Yau 3-fold. This semiorthogonal decomposition is interpreted as a\nLanglands dual to the semiorthogonal decomposition constructed in our previous\nwork on the category of coherent sheaves on the moduli stack of semistable\nHiggs bundles. We also construct Hecke operators on limit categories for Higgs\nbundles. They are expected to be compatible with Wilson operators under our\nformulation of Dolbeault geometric Langlands conjecture. The conjectured\nequivalence implies an equivalence between BPS categories for semistable Higgs\nbundles, which we expect to be a categorical version of the topological mirror\nsymmetry conjecture for Higgs bundles by Hausel-Thaddeus."}
