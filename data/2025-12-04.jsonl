An immediate corollary affirms the relative symplectic Thom conjecture and, moreover, yields obstructions coming from knot Floer homology to a link bounding a symplectic surface in a symplectic filling. Our results are applicable to knots in manifolds equipped with plane fields that admit no symplectic fillings; for instance, we show that symplectic surfaces in a thickening of any contact 3-manifold with non-zero Ozsvath-Szabo invariant minimize slice genus for their boundary. We conjecture that this phenomenon occurs precisely when the contact structure is tight, which would imply that tightness can be viewed as a symplecto-geometric notion."}

We establish a Generalized Inflation Theorem, demonstrating that for central polynomials, the root set forms a homogeneous space $G/H$, where $G$ is the automorphism group of the algebra ($SO(3)$ for $\\mathbb{H}$, $G_2$ for $\\mathbb{O}$). This mechanism generates continuous geometry from non-commutativity. We analyze the dynamics under central modulation (breathing modes), classifying topological bifurcations ($Δ=0$). We then analyze the topological collapse induced by non-central perturbations, governed by symmetry reduction. We utilize the Localization Theorem (Gordon-Motzkin) to explain the alignment of roots with coefficient subalgebras. We formalize the dynamics of collapse using gradient flow on the potential landscape $\\mathcal{V}(x) = \\|P(x)\\|^2$, characterizing it as a deformation retract and proving that the collapse timescale exhibits critical slowing down with quadratic scaling ($T_{\\rm collapse} \\propto ε^{-2}$). Finally, we introduce a thermodynamic formalism, proving an Entropy Scaling Law that rigorously characterizes the collapse as a symmetry-breaking phase transition."}

Using the interpretation of Brauer classes as obstructions to descending determinantal line bundles from the algebraic closure, together with a geometric analysis of the moduli space of twisted sheaves, we prove that for genus $2$ curves there exist Brauer classes over the base field whose period equals their index. Over $C_1$-fields, we further show that every $2$-torsion class in the Brauer group of a genus $2$ curve satisfies the period-index problem. As an application, we construct higher-dimensional varieties obtained as fibre products of genus $2$ curves over $C_1$-fields whose $2$-torsion algebraic Brauer classes also satisfy the period-index problem, providing new evidence toward the period-index conjecture."}

We regard a Euclidean lattice as a hermitian vector bundle $\\bar E$ on ${\\rm Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ and consider two typical arithmetic analogues of the dimension of the space of global sections of a vector bundle on an algebraic curve. One is $$h^0_{\\rm Ar}(\\bar E):=\\log \\vert E\\cap B_1 \\vert$$ where $B_1$ is the unit ball, and the other is $$h^0_θ(\\bar{E}):=\\log\\sum_{v\\in E}e^{-π\\Vert v\\Vert^2}$$ where $\\sum_{v\\in E}e^{-π\\Vert v\\Vert^2}$ is the theta function of $\\bar E$. In this paper, we shall prove the following three statements: (i) the fact that one can not reach an absolute Riemann-Roch theorem for $h^0_{\\rm Ar}(\\bar E)$ is an instance of the Heissenberg uncertainty principle; (ii) the finiteness of equivalence classes in the genus of a positive quadratic form defined over $\\mathbb{Z}$ is equivalent to the finiteness of certain isometry classes of hermitian vector bundles on ${\\rm Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$, and it can be deduced from a finiteness theorem in Arakelov theory of ${\\rm Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$; (iii) for any smooth function $f$ on $\\mathbb{R}_{+}$ such that $f>0$ and that $f\\circ {\\rm exp}$ is a Schwartz function on $\\mathbb{R}$, the Mellin transform of $f$ can be written as an integral over the Arakelov divisor class group of ${\\rm Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$."}
