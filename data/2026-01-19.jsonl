Using the interpolation matrix introduced in [DMTG25], we describe these loci as the zero sets of explicit determinants depending on parameters $(d,m)$ determined by the number of points. We show that for points in general position the determinant defines an irreducible curve of the expected degree, while for special configurations it acquires fixed components related to the combinatorics of the arrangement. The approach provides a new geometric interpretation of the classical jumping lines of Dolgachev--Kapranov and Barth, and connects them to the framework of unexpected curves and hypersurfaces."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "A main conjecture in the field of Positive Geometry states that amplituhedra are positive geometries. It is motivated by examples showing that the canonical forms of certain amplituhedra compute scattering amplitudes in particle physics. In recent work, Brown and Dupont introduced a new framework, based on mixed Hodge theory, connecting canonical forms and de Rham cohomology. In this paper, we show that this framework is consistent with the known results for amplituhedra but does not apply beyond those families. We provide an explicit example showing that the central assumption of the Brown-Dupont framework (namely to have a pair of genus zero) is not a necessary condition to be a positive geometry in the original sense of Arkani-Hamed, Bai, and Lam. This underscores the fact that our results do not immediately disqualify the amplituhedron from being a positive geometry."}

We classify the lens spaces $L(p,q)$ for which every smooth negative-definite filling $X$ satisfies \\[ b_2(X)\\ge b_2(X(p,q))-1, \\] where $X(p,q)$ denotes the canonical negative-definite plumbing. The classification is given by 17 \"forbidden configurations\" that cannot appear as induced subgraphs of the canonical plumbing graph. More generally, we introduce a combinatorial framework that encodes the lattice embedding information coming from the dual plumbing of $X(p,q)$, and we prove that it is governed by a finite set of minimal forbidden configurations. We also discuss consequences for symplectic fillings of lens spaces and for smoothings of cyclic quotient singularities."}

Soteros"], "title": "Entanglement complexity of spanning pairs of lattice polygons", "comment": null, "summary": "We study the entanglement complexity of a system consisting of two simple-closed curves (self-avoiding polygons) that span a lattice tube, referred to as a 2SAP. 2SAPs are of interest as the first known model of confined ring polymers where the linking probability goes to 1 exponentially with the size of the system. Atapour et al proved this in 2010 by showing that all but exponentially few sufficiently large 2SAPs contain a pattern that guarantees the 2SAP is non-split, provided that the requisite pattern fits in the tube. This result was recently extended to all tubes sizes that admit non-trivial links. Here we develop and apply knot theory results to answer more general questions about the entanglement complexity of 2SAPs.\n  We first extend the 1992 concept of a good measure of knot complexity to a good measure, $F$, of spanning-link complexity for $k$-component links. Using tangle products, we show, for example, that the more complex the prime knot decomposition of any component of a given link type, the greater its $F$-measure. We then prove that all but exponentially few size $m$ 2SAPs have $F$ complexity that grows at least linearly in $m$ as $m\\to \\infty$. We establish that good measures of knot complexity yield good measures of spanning-link complexity. We also establish conditions whereby more general link invariants can yield good measures. In particular, we establish that measures based on several classical invariants are good measures by our definition, eg bridge number or the number of $p$-colourings.\n  Finally, we consider how the tube dimensions affect which links are embeddable as 2SAPs as well as geometric restrictions on the entanglement complexity of the embeddings. For example, we establish that there are two-component links that occur as 2SAPs in a given tube size only when one of the components is forced into a non-minimal bridge number conformation."}
