We reinterpret this picture via Isbell duality: viewing $M$ as an $Rbar$-enriched profunctor $M$: $C^{op}\\otimes D\\to Rbar$, we study the associated order-reversing Isbell adjunction $M^*\\dashv M_*$ and its fixed-point locus, the nucleus $Nuc(M)$. After projectivization, $pnuc(M)$ carries two interacting geometries. On the metric side, $Rbar$-enrichment induces a canonical Hilbert projective--type (max-spread) metric on projective (co)presheaves, and we show that the projective Isbell maps identify the presheaf and copresheaf realizations of $pnuc(M)$ by mutually inverse isometries. On the polyhedral side, in the discrete real setting the Isbell inequalities cut out a canonical polyhedral decomposition of $pnuc(M)$ recovering the usual tropical cell structure. Our main new ingredient is a pointwise invariant of a nucleus point $(f,g)$: the nonnegative $\\textit{gap matrix}$ $δ^{(f,g)}(c,d)=M(c,d)-f(c)-g(d)$. Its zero pattern determines the cell containing $(f,g)$, while its positive entries compute exact metric distances to the boundary strata where additional inequalities become tight (Events Theorem). This distance-to-wall principle refines cells into order chambers and supports a constructible tower of complete lattices obtained by thresholding $δ^{(f,g)}$."}

Then, we prove that it leads to knot Floer homology and opens avenues for explicit geometric categorifications for the Jones polynomial. This model codifies the difference between the geometry of the Alexander and Jones polynomials via a quantum deformation of the Alexander grading, constructed on the surface.\n  We do so by introducing a new type of diagram, called \"quantum Heegaard diagram\" (encoding the knot complement) together with a \"quantum Alexander grading\". This grading is a refinement of the Alexander grading used in knot Floer homology. Then we define a graded Lagrangian intersection, in two variables, between concrete Lagrangian submanifolds arising from the curves of the diagram in the symmetric power of the quantum Heegaard surface. The two-variable intersection unifies and recovers the Jones and Alexander polynomials as two specialisations of coefficients. Moreover, this leads to knot Floer homology on one side and provides an intersection model for the Jones polynomial on the other. The surface and Lagrangian submanifolds are concretely constructed via braid actions on the punctured disc."}
