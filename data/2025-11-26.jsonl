For both Kummer and Artin-Schreier extensions, we describe precise $k$-bases for the cohomology groups $H^{1}(X,\\mathcal{O}_{X})$ and $H^{0}(X,Ω_{X})$, and we use these to construct an explicit basis for the first de Rham cohomology group $H^{1}_{\\mathrm{dR}}(X/k)$ via Čech cohomology. Our approach relies on detailed computations of divisors of functions and differentials, together with residue calculations and the duality pairing between $H^{0}(X,Ω_{X})$ and $H^{1}(X,\\mathcal{O}_{X})$. The resulting expressions are given in closed form in terms of the defining equation of the cover, making the cohomology fully explicit and readily applicable to questions involving group actions, and the study of $p$-cyclic covers."}

Hashizume's 1958 theorem that every non-split link in $S^3$ admits a unique factorization into prime links. While the new proof does not go far beyond standard techniques, it is considerably shorter than the original proof and avoids most of its case exhaustion.\n  We apply this proof to obtain a string link version (and also an alternative proof) of a 1972 theorem of D. Rolfsen: two PL links in $S^3$ are ambient isotopic if and only if they are PL isotopic and their respective components are ambient isotopic. It is tempting to dismiss this string link version as obvious by deriving it directly either from Rolfsen's or Hashizume's theorem. But this does not seem to be possible, as it turns out that there exists a string link that has no local knots, while its closure has a local knot."}

Namely, given a real vector bundle with orthogonal connection, we construct R/Z -valued eta-invariants in the context of Atiyah--Patodi--Singer and Z2 Atiyah--Singer index invariants that completely determine differential KO-theory in degree (0 mod 8); we call this the differential KO-character.
