We propose a definition of the volume of these objects as the integral of a tautological class on the projectivization of the stratum. By previous work with Chen-Möller-Zagier, this definition agrees with the Masur-Veech volumes in the holomorphic case. We show that these algebraic constants can be computed by induction on the genus and number of singularities. Besides, for strata with a single zero, we prove that the generating series of these volumes is a solution of an integrable system associated with the PDE: $u_tu_{xx}=u_tu_x+u_t - 1$."}

Focusing on shallow networks with two neurons, quadratic activation, and scalar output, we identify the associated neurovariety with the second secant variety of a quadratic Veronese embedding. We introduce and analyze the virtual Euclidean Distance degree, a projective invariant defined as the sum of the polar degrees of the variety, which coincides with the usual Euclidean Distance degree for a generic choice of scalar product. Using intersection theory, Chern-Mather classes, and the Nash blow-up provided by Kempf's resolution, we reduce the computation of the virtual Euclidean Distance degree to explicit intersection numbers on a Grassmannian. Applying equivariant localization, we prove that this invariant depends stably polynomially on the input dimension. Numerical experiments based on homotopy continuation illustrate the dependence of the Euclidean Distance degree on the chosen metric and highlight the distinction between the generic and nongeneric cases, such as the Bombieri-Weyl metric."}

This scenario arises in machine learning when the dataset size is small with respect to the model, and is typically referred to as overparametrization. Our main result relates the degenerate optimization problem to a nondegenerate one via a projection. In the highly-degenerate regime, we find that a central role is played by the ramification locus of the projection. Additionally, we provide tools for counting the number of critical points over projective varieties, and discuss specific cases arising from deep learning. Our work bridges tools from algebraic geometry with ideas from machine learning, and it extends the line of literature around the Euclidean distance degree to the degenerate setting."}

Comments and suggestions welcome!", "summary": "We study the Teichmüller space $\\mathcal{T}(S,\\underline{p})$ of hyperbolic cone-surfaces of fixed topological type with marked cone singularities. Fix a combinatorial triangulation $G$, and let $\\mathcal{T}(G)\\subset \\mathcal{T}(S,\\underline{p})$ be the locus where $G$ admits a geodesic realization; varying $G$, these loci form an open cover of $\\mathcal{T}(S,\\underline{p})$. On $\\mathcal{T}(G)$ we construct a circular foliation adapted to geodesic triangular complementary regions, which is naturally decomposed into interior and peripheral parts. This decomposition defines shear parameters on edges and radius parameters at the singularities, and yields global coordinates on $\\mathcal{T}(G)$: the resulting shear-radius map is a homeomorphism onto an explicit open cone in a finite-dimensional real vector space. In the spirit of Thurston, we then introduce partial stretch and anti-stretch deformations by rescaling the transverse measures of the interior or peripheral components. Peripheral stretch rays converge, in the simple-curve length-spectrum topology, to the cusped hyperbolic metric determined by the shear data, while interior anti-stretch rays converge to a circle-packed hyperbolic cone metric determined by the radii. Finally, we give criteria for the realization of prescribed cone angles for fixed $G$ and prove sharp upper bounds for admissible cone angles on the universally triangulable locus."}

We establish the Chevalley-Weil formula for pluricanonical representations of a curve with a finite group action and a decomposition theorem for pluricanonical systems of abelian covers. These tools allow an explicit study of geometric properties of $X$, such as base loci and the birationality of pluricanonical maps. For threefolds isogenous to a product, we prove that the 4-canonical map is birational for $p_g \\ge 5$ and construct an example attaining the maximal canonical degree for this class of threefolds. In this example, the canonical map is the normalization of its image, which admits isolated non-normal singularities. Computational classifications also reveal threefolds where the bicanonical map fails to be birational, even in the absence of genus-2 fibrations. This illustrates an interesting phenomenon similar to the non-standard case for surfaces."}
