Comments welcome!", "summary": "We construct infinite families of non-simple isotopy classes of links in overtwisted contact structures on $S^1$-bundles over surfaces. These examples include: (1) a pair of Legendrian links that are not Legendrian isotopic, but which are isotopic as framed links, homotopic as Legendrian immersed multi-curves, and have Legendrian-isotopic components and (2) a pair of Legendrian links that are not Legendrian isotopic, but are isotopic as framed links, homotopic as Legendrian immersed multi-curves, and which are link-homotopic as Legendrian links. Moreover, we construct examples showing that both of these non-simplicity phenomena can occur in the same smooth isotopy class. To construct these examples, we develop the theory of links transverse to a nowhere-zero vector field in a 3-manifold, and construct analogous examples in the category of links transverse to a vector field."}

A welded link is defined as an equivalence class of link diagrams that may contain virtual crossings, where the equivalence is generated by the classical and virtual Reidemeister moves together with the welded moves. In this paper, we introduce a parallelization construction for welded link diagrams and show that it is well defined: if two diagrams represent equivalent welded links, then the corresponding parallel diagrams obtained by our construction are also equivalent. When the two parallel strands are given parallel orientations, the resulting diagram admits a checkerboard coloring, whereas if they are assigned opposite orientations, the diagram is almost classical. Our construction further yields a decomposition in which one component is a copy of the original diagram and the other is a diagram representing a trivial welded link. We also investigate quandle colorings and the fundamental quandle of the parallel diagram, deriving a presentation from that of the original diagram. Finally, we examine conditions under which the parallel diagram is non-split."}

A key technical ingredient is the study of elementary transforms along effective divisors and their commutativity properties.\n  In dimension two, we analyze the behavior of hierarchical depth under birational morphisms and show that it admits a precise description along the minimal model program.
