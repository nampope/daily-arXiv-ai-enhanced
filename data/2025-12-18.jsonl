Algebra Engrg. Comm. Comput. dedicated to the memory of Joos Heintz", "summary": "We develop a probabilistic algorithm of Kronecker type for computing a Kronecker representation of a zero-dimensional linear section of an algebraic variety $V$ defined over a perfect field $k$. The variety $V$ is the Zariski closure of the set of common zeros $\\{F_1=0,\\ldots,F_r=0,G\\not=0\\}$ of multivariate polynomials $F_1,\\ldots,F_r\\in k[X_1,\\ldots,X_n]$ outside a prescribed hypersurface $\\{G=0\\}$. We assume that $F_1,\\ldots,F_r$ satisfy natural geometric conditions, such as regularity and radicality, in the local ring $k[X_1,\\ldots,X_n]_G$. Our approach combines homotopic deformation techniques with symbolic Newton-Hensel lifting and elimination. We discuss the concept of lifting curves as intermediate geometric objects that enable efficient computation.\n  The complexity of the algorithm is expressed in terms of the degrees and arithmetic size of the input and achieves soft-quadratic complexity in these parameters. We provide detailed complexity analyses for arbitrary perfect fields, as well as for two important cases in computer algebra: finite fields and the field of rational numbers. For each case, we obtain sharp bounds on the size of the base field or required primes."}

The correspondence provides examples of the log/local principle of van Garrel-Graber-Ruddat in the multi-component setting and the refined conjecture of Brini-Bousseau-van Garrel via intermediate geometries. It also establishes the multi-component case of the open/closed correspondence proposed by Lerche-Mayr and studied by Liu-Yu. As an application, we obtain examples of the conjecture of Klemm-Pandharipande on the integrality of BPS invariants of higher-dimensional toric Calabi-Yau manifolds.

As an application, we prove that Mumford-Tate general hyperkähler varieties cannot be covered by families of elliptic curves passing through a fixed point. By extending work of Hotchkiss, Maulik, Shen, Yin, and Zhang, we prove the hyperkähler period-index conjecture for non-special coprime Brauer class on hyperkähler varieties of K3^n-type without any restriction on the Picard number."}

We studies the hyperbolicity of complex quasi-projective varieties $X$ in the presence of a big and reductive representation $\\varrho: π_1(X)\\to {\\rm GL}_N(\\mathbb{C})$. For any Galois conjugate variety $X^σ$ with $σ\\in {\\rm Aut}(\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{Q})$, we prove the generalized Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture. When $\\varrho$ is furthermore large, we show that the special subsets of $X^σ$ describing the non-hyperbolicity locus coincide, and that this locus is proper exactly when $X$ is of log general type. Moreover, if the Zariski closure of $ρ(π_1(X))$ is semisimple, we prove that there exists a proper Zariski closed subset $Z \\subsetneq X^σ$ such that every subvariety not contained in $Z$ is of log general type and all entire curves in $X^σ$ are contained in $Z$. This result extends the theorems of the third author (2010) and of Campana-Claudon-Eyssidieux (2015) from projective to quasi-projective varieties, and yields stronger conclusions even in the projective case."}

Our approach does not assume semisimplicity, and is based on a generalization of the Reshetikhin-Turaev functor to the category of labeled Kirby graphs which also yields invariants of framed links in the boundary of $4$-dimensional $2$-handlebodies up to $2$-deformations. The setup is very flexible, and allows for several different constructions, using central elements satisfying equations introduced by Hennings and Bobtcheva-Messia, modified traces, and modules over Frobenius algebras satisfying conditions dictated by the diagrammatic calculus for embedded surfaces developed by Hughes, Kim, and Miller."}

Special cases of our results show that equidimensional fibrations over normal $\\mathbf{Q}$-schemes or regular schemes of arbitrary characteristic are strongly pure. The main ingredient is a new factorization result for locally equidimensional morphisms of schemes, which is of independent interest. Additionally, we prove a weak Boutot-type theorem for $F$-rationality, which says that $F$-rationality descends under pure ring maps that are locally equidimensional under universally catenary assumptions. This statement is false without the locally equidimensional hypothesis."}
