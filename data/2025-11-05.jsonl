Comments welcome!", "summary": "We develop a new method for establishing the extremality in the closed cone\nof effective curves on the moduli space of curves and determine the extremality\nof many boundary $1$-strata. As a consequence, by using a general criterion for\nnon-semiampleness which extends Keel's argument, we demonstrate that a\nsubstantial portion of the cone of nef divisors of\n$\\overline{\\mathrm{M}}_{g,n}$ is not semiample. As an application, we construct\nthe first explicit example of a non-contractible extremal ray of the closed\ncone of effective curves on $\\overline{\\mathrm{M}}_{3,n}$. Our method relies on\ntwo main ingredients: (1) the construction of a new collection of nef divisors\non $\\overline{\\mathrm{M}}_{g,n}$, and (2) the identification of a tractable\ninductive structure on the Picard group, arising from Knudsen's construction of\n$\\overline{\\mathrm{M}}_{g,n}$."}
