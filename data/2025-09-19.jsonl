Current\nmethods primarily focus on lower-order topological features, often overlooking\nthe significance of higher-order features such as connected components, cycles,\nand cavities. These higher-order features are critical for understanding normal\nbrain function and have been increasingly linked to the pathological mechanisms\nof AD. However, their quantification for diagnosing AD is hindered by their\ninherent nonlinearity and stochasticity in the brain. This paper introduces a\nnovel framework for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease that uses persistent\nhomology to extract higher-order topological features from fMRI data. It also\nintroduces four quantitative methods that capture subtle, multiscale geometric\nvariations in functional brain networks associated with AD. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that this framework significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in AD classification. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability\nanalysis confirm the effectiveness of our framework. Our study also reveals\nthat the number of cycles or cavities significantly decrease in AD patients.\nThe extracted key brain regions derived from cycles and cavities align with\ndomain knowledge in neuroscience literature and provide direct and insightful\nfindings. This study highlights the potential of higher-order topological\nfeatures for early AD detection and significantly advances the field of brain\ntopology analysis in neurodegenerative disease research."}
