We use it to compute the maximal cusp area matrix; this completely characterizes the space of all embedded and disjoint cusp neighborhoods. As another application of our work, we find the Epstein-Penner decomposition answering a challenge of Sakuma and Weeks. We furthermore provide the refinements needed to make our algorithm verified: producing intervals provably containing the correct answer. As key ingredient for our work and perhaps of independent interest, we give new and simpler expressions for the distances between points, lines, and planes in the hyperboloid model."}

For the exact/Waldhausen categories of finitely generated bi-positional $n$-ary $\\Ga$-modules, perfect complexes in the derived category, and perfect quasi-coherent complexes on the non-commutative $\\Ga$-spectrum $\\SpecGnC{T}$, we prove Waldhausen Fibration and Additivity theorems and Quillen-type Localization for Serre and Waldhausen pairs. Under natural hypotheses on $\\Ga$-stable filtrations we obtain dévissage and Approximation theorems, together with cofinality and Karoubi invariance, showing that idempotent completion does not change $K$-theory and that cofinal subcategories control $K_n$ in positive degrees. We further derive a Bass--Quillen fundamental triangle for polynomial extensions in the $n$-ary $\\Ga$-context and prove nilpotent invariance for two-sided $\\Ga$-ideals. In geometric terms, these results yield localization and Mayer--Vietoris sequences for the $K$-theory of $\\Perf(X)$ on $X=\\SpecGnC{T}$ and its admissible open covers. Altogether, the paper shows that the higher $K$-theory of non-commutative $n$-ary $\\Ga$-semirings enjoys the same formal properties as in the classical ring and scheme cases, providing a robust foundation for subsequent computational and homotopy-theoretic applications."}

We also show that X must be separably rationally connected in any characteristic if d = 4 and n is sufficiently large. Along the way, we generalize results on the spaces of k-planes in X to characteristic p and connect some of these questions to the spaces of linear sections of X."}

We also compare properties of affine algebraic racks, commutative corack algebras, and their Leibniz algebras."}

When $X$ is a linear subspace, this data locus is known as the Kalman variety of $X$ and was studied first by Ottaviani and Sturmfels. Motivated by recent applications to quantum chemistry and optimization, in this work, we focus on nonlinear Kalman varieties, that is, Kalman varieties relative to arbitrary projective varieties $X$. We study the basic invariants of these varieties, such as their dimensions, degrees, and singularities. Furthermore, Ottaviani and Sturmfels provide determinantal equations in the linear case. We generalize their result to Kalman varieties of hypersurfaces by providing a determinantal-like description of their equation."}
