Comments welcome!", "summary": "The moduli space of twisted holomorphic 1-forms on Riemann surfaces,\nequivalently dilation surfaces with scaling, admits a stratification and\nGL(2,R)-action as in the case of moduli spaces of translation surfaces. We\nproduce an analogue of Masur-Veech measure, i.e. an SL(2,R)-invariant Lebesgue\nclass measure on strata or explicit covers thereof. This relies on a novel\ncomputation of cohomology with coefficients for the mapping class group. The\ncomputation produces a framed mapping class group invariant measure on\nrepresentation varieties that naturally appear as the codomains of the periods\nmaps that coordinatize strata."}
