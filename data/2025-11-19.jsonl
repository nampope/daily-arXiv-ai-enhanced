The mapping class group of $X$ is defined as the group of smooth isotopy classes of diffeomorphisms of $X$. The Torelli group of $X$ is the subgroup of the mapping class group consisting of smooth isotopy classes of diffeomorphisms which are continuously isotopic to the identity. We prove that for each $n \\ge 10$, the Torelli group of $2\\mathbb{CP}^2 \\# n \\overline{\\mathbb{CP}^2}$ surjects to $\\mathbb{Z}^\\infty$. We also prove that the mapping class group of $2 \\mathbb{CP}^2 \\# 10 \\overline{\\mathbb{CP}^2}$ is not finitely generated. Our proofs of these results makes use of Seiberg-Witten invariants for $1$-parameter familes of $4$-manifolds and in particular a gluing formula for connected sum families. Since the manifolds we consider have $b_+ = 2$, the chamber structure of the $1$-parameter Seiberg-Witten invariants plays an important role."}

We give bounds for the largest numerical wall that may appear. When $R=0$, these bounds in particular produce the first known bounds for the Gieseker chamber in the case of a threefold. We also study the cases $R=0$ and $D=3,4$ in detail using a small algorithm in Python."}

These notions range from algebraic geometric, complex geometric, representation theoretic, combinatorial, convex geometric, to geometric stability. The main theorem gives the relationship between these notions. While mostly folklore knowledge, this does not seem to be readily available in the literature. Finally, we take the opportunity to give an accessible and simplified proof of Demazure's 1970 structure theorem for the automorphism group of a smooth toric variety, previously considered quite inaccessible."}

This deformation defines a real analytic section of the relative Dolbeault moduli space, yielding a real analytic foliation on this moduli. This foliation generalizes the Betti foliation defined by the Betti map in the study of abelian schemes. We provide a precise form for the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic derivatives of the isomonodromic deformation of a Higgs bundle. Subsequently, we extend the classical non-abelian Kodaira-Spencer map using the anti-holomorphic derivative. Additionally, we prove that if the isomonodromic deformation of a graded Higgs bundle is not holomorphic, then the isomonodromically deformed Higgs field is non-nilpotent."}
