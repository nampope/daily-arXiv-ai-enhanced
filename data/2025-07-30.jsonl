That is,\nthere exists a smooth scheme $\\widetilde{Y}$ and a projective birational\nmorphism from $\\widetilde{Y}$ onto $Y$, followed by a smooth morphism from $Y$\nonto $X$.\n  Our approach differs fundamentally from existing methods, as we neither\nrestrict to any specific singular variety nor fix the characteristic. Instead,\nwe design a {\\it universal} blowup process that {\\it simultaneously} resolves\nall possible singularities, and, our method is entirely characteristic-free."}
