We study which of these knots are slice, in both the smooth and topological categories. While no algorithm is known for deciding whether a given knot is slice in either setting, we are able to determine it smoothly for all but about 11,400 knots (0.003% or 1 in 30,000) and topologically for all but about 1,400 knots (0.0004% or about 1 in 250,000). In particular, we show that some 1.6 million of these knots (0.46%) are smoothly slice (in fact ribbon) and that 350.5 million are not even topologically slice (99.54%). We use a wide range of tools and techniques, and introduce several new or refined methods for probing these properties. Along the way, we produce 500,000 pairs of 0-friends, that is, pairs of distinct knots with the same 0-surgery. We discuss how our data is consistent with several important conjectures and suggests new ones, and highlight the simplest knots where sliceness remains unknown."}

Along the way, we establish several foundational results on morphisms of rigid spaces: we prove generic flatness and openness of the flat locus in the rigid setting, and we show that (for affinoid rigid spaces) strict transforms become flat after a blowup. Moreover, we show that any fppf cover admits a quasi-finite refinement and prove a version of Zariski's main theorem for rigid spaces. As an application, we deduce that for a proper rigid space $X$ over $C$, the category of pro-étale vector bundles on $X$ is equivalent to the category of Higgs bundles on the $h$-site of $X$, thereby generalizing Heuer's results to the singular setting."}

The compactification $X$ can be chosen to be a $\\mathbb{Q}$-factorial log Fano variety whenever $U$ is $\\mathbb{Q}$-factorial. Furthermore, we prove that a $\\mathbb{Q}$-factorial klt Fano variety $X$ is of cluster type if and only if its Cox ring ${\\rm Cox}(X)$ is a ${\\rm Cl}(X)$-graded mutation semigroup algebra. In order to enlighten the previous theorems, we provide several explicit examples motivated by birational geometry, representation theory, and combinatorics."}

The Malyshev problem is of finding effective, explicit necessary and sufficient conditions in the closed form to characterize all random walks in the quarter plane with a finite group of the random walk of order $2n$, for all $n\\ge 2$, in the generic case where the underlining biquadratic is an elliptic curve. Until now, the results were known only for $n=2, 3, 4$ and were obtained using ad-hoc methods developed separately for each of the three cases. We provide a method that solves the problem for all $n$ and in a unified way. We also consider situations with singular biquadratics. Further, we establish a new two-way relationship between \\emph{diagonal} random walks in the quarter plane and $4$-bar links. We describe all $n$-periodic Darboux transformations for $4$-bar link problems for all $n\\ge 2$, thus completely solving the Darboux problem, that he solved for $n=2$. We introduce \\emph{$k$ semi-periodicity} as a novel and natural type of periodicity of the Darboux transformations, where after $k$ iterations of the Darboux transformation, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one, but of opposite orientation. By introducing new objects, \\emph{the secondary $(2-2)$-correspondence} and the related \\emph{secondary cubic} of the centrally-symmetric biquadratics, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for $k$-semi-periodicity for $4$-bar links for all $k\\ge 2$ in an explicit closed form."}

We construct four automorphic forms on $\\mathbb{B}_3$ expressing the inverse of the period map, and give an equality between one of them and a period integral, which is an analogy of Jacobi's formula between a theta constant and an elliptic integral. We find a transformation of $\\mathbb{B}_3$ such that the quaternary of means appears by its actions on the four automorphic forms.
