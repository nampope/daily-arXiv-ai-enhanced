Furthermore, we show that this isomorphism lifts to the\nlevel of $B_{\\infty}$-algebras of the chain complexes, by showing that the\nopposite $B_{\\infty}$-algebra of the relative Hochschild cochains of the right\nalgebra is isomorphic to the $B_{\\infty}$-algebra of Cartier cochains. Lastly,\nwe apply this to entwining structures where the coalgebra is\nfinite-dimensional, to get a description of the equivariant cohomology of the\nentwining structure as the relative Hochschild cohomology of the twisted\nconvolution algebra."}

The invariant is a\ngeneralization of the $sl(2|1)$-series invariant $\\hat{Z}(q)$ for closed\n3-manifolds introduced by Ferrari and Putrov and an extension of the two\nvariable series invariant defined by Gukov and Manolescu (GM) to the Lie\nsuperalgebra. We derive a surgery formula relating $F_K (y,z,q)$ to\n$\\hat{Z}(q)$ invariant. We find appropriate expansion chambers for certain\ninfinite families of torus knots and compute explicit examples. Furthermore, we\nprovide evidence for a non semisimple $Spin^c$ decorated TQFT from the three\nvariable series. We observe that the super $F_K (y,z,q)$ itself and its results\nexhibit distinctive features compared to the GM series."}

Using this\nfactorization, we express the Milnor number and other indices as quadratic\nforms in intersection vectors associated to balanced divisors introduced by Y.\nGenzmer. As a main application, we address a conjecture posed by A. Szawlowski\nconcerning pencils of plane holomorphic germs. We prove that the excess of\nMilnor numbers along the pencil is precisely captured by the invariants derived\nfrom our formulas, thereby confirming the conjecture in full generality. This\nalso yields a new expression for the dimension of the parameter space of\nuniversal unfoldings of meromorphic functions in the sense of T. Suwa."}

Additionally, we study the local behavior of quasi-perfect\nmorphisms, showing that for proper morphisms this property can be detected via\nstalks, and completions and (strict) Henselizations of those.
