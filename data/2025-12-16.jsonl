From this we obtain a direct sum decomposition of the localizing invariants of the $\\infty$-category of constructible sheaves. Since the $\\ast$-pullback to the open stratum in the usual (recollement) semi-orthogonal decomposition is not strongly left adjoint, this splitting does not follow from pure sheaf theory considerations. Instead, the splitting crucially relies on the exodromy equivalence: it implies that on the level of constructible sheaves, the $\\ast$-pullback to a closed stratum and the $!$-pushforward from an open stratum admit left adjoints. These new functors provide an additional semi-orthogonal decomposition (with the roles of open and closed reversed) in which the relevant functors are strongly left adjoint."}

We study in details the Hodge-Tate case, which can be read off from the ages of the sectors, a variation of the hard Lefschetz condition introduced by Fernandez. These notes go along with prior works of Fernandez and Wang."}

An Hermitian metric on the exterior algebra of the cotangent bundle is also defined and we establish the corresponding theory of harmonic forms, relating the global metric and local metric. This generalizes the classical Hodge theory. As an immediate application we give a new proof of Dinh-Nguyen's theorem on the Hodge-Riemann relations for mixed Kähler classes. We give several other applications to the Lefschetz property and Hodge-Riemann relations of Chern classes of ample vector bundles."}

Banana curves are reducible rational curves obtained as a degeneration of hyperelliptic curves. In this work, we relate the family of KP multi-solitons arising from banana curves together with non-special divisors of fixed degree to the combinatorics of the tropical theta divisor of the curve. We describe the Voronoi and Delaunay polytopes and show that the latter are combinatorially equivalent to uniform matroid polytopes. As a consequence, the combinatorics of the tropical theta divisor canonically encodes the matroid and Grassmannian structures underlying the associated KP multi-soliton solutions. We define the Hirota variety of a banana graph, which parametrizes all tau functions arising from such a graph. Starting from the matroid arising from Delaunay polytopes and the periods in the tropical limit, we construct an explicit parametrization of this variety which realizes the tau function as a multi-soliton. Our framework specializes naturally to real and positive settings."}

For a given multiple zeta value $ζ$, there exists a unique minimal motive $M(ζ)$ such that $ζ$ is a period of $M(ζ)$. In general, the motive $M(ζ)$ is difficult to compute. In this article, we compute the minimal motive $M(a,b)$ associated to a given double zeta value $ζ(a,b)$. We also compute the motivic Galois group $G(a,b)$ associated to $ζ(a,b)$ and discuss its dimension. Moreover, we give a period matrix of $M(a,b)$. The period conjecture predicts that the dimension of $G(a,b)$ equals the transcendence degree of the algebra of periods of $M(a,b)$. Hence our results lead to conjectures about algebraic relations between single and double zeta values."}

We utilize this geometric description to derive local-global compatibility results and, adapting the strategy of Zhu and Yang, apply the unipotent categorical local Langlands correspondence to prove a general vanishing theorem for the generic part of the cohomology of meta-unitary Shimura varieties."}
