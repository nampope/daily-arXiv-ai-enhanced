Comments are welcome!", "summary": "This paper investigates defining equations for secant varieties of the\nvariety of reducible polynomials, which geometrically encode the notions of\nstrength and slice rank of homogeneous polynomials. We present three main\nresults. First, we reinterpret Ruppert's classical equations for reducible\nternary forms in the language of representation theory and we extend them to an\narbitrary number of variables. Second, we construct new determinantal equations\nfor polynomials of small strength based on syzygies of their partial\nderivatives. Finally, we establish a reduction theorem for cubic forms, proving\nthat slice rank two is determined by generic linear sections in $14$ variables;\nthis gives one of the few explicit upper bounds for defining equations for the\nimage of a polynomial map in the framework of noetherianity for polynomial\nfunctors."}

We consider two special cases: the\nfirst is an augmented curve, i.e., the gluing of the derived categories of a\npoint and a curve with the gluing bimodule given by the structure sheaf of the\ncurve; the second is an ideal point gluing of curves, i.e., the gluing of the\nderived categories of two curves with the gluing bimodule given by the ideal\nsheaf of a point in the product of the curves. We construct unexpected\nexceptional objects contained in these categories and discuss their orthogonal\ncomplements.\n  We also show that the simplest example of compact type degeneration of\ncurves, a flat family of curves with a smooth general fiber and a 1-nodal\nreducible central fiber, gives rise to a smooth and proper family of\ntriangulated categories with the general fiber an augmented curve and the\ncentral fiber the orthogonal complement of the exotic exceptional object in the\nideal point gluing of curves, called the reduced ideal point gluing of curves."}
