We show that,\nup to a combinatorial factor, the degree of these varieties equals the volume\nof a polytope. We deduce defining equations from rank constraints on a matrix\nwith polynomial entries. We discuss applications of Lissajous varieties in\ndynamical systems, in particular the Kuramoto model. This leads us to study\nconnections with convex optimization and Lissajous discriminants."}

The resulting\nefficiency enables computations that were previously out of reach. We briefly\ndescribe the design principles, capabilities, and algorithms of the new\nimplementation and illustrate them with examples that showcase its power.\nRather than comparing speeds, our goal is to advertise the package by\ndemonstrating what can now be achieved in practice. We also add one core\ncapability: computing linear systems of plane curves with prescribed\nnon-ordinary singularities."}
