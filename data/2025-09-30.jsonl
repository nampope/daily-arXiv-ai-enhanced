The famous Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem\n[13] of 1965 uses the Grothendieck construction [4] of 1956 that associates\nvector bundles $E(\\sigma)$ on $X$ to representations $\\sigma$ of a certain\nFuchsian group $\\pi$. Narasimhan and Seshadri show that by taking the\nrepresentations $\\sigma$ to be irreducible unitary of a certain kind, this\nexactly gives all stable vector bundles on $X$ of a given rank and degree.\n  In this note we reformulate the correspondence from representations to\nbundles, which leads to simpler statements and proofs. The Fuchsian group $\\pi$\nis replaced by the punctured fundamental group $\\pi_1(X-x)$ where $x\\in X$. The\nGrothendieck bundles $E(\\sigma)$ then become Deligne's logarithmic extensions\nto $X$ of bundles with connections on $X-x$ associated to representations of\n$\\pi_1(X-x)$ with scalar local monodromy. We also report how some ideas from\nalgebraic geometry (which were all in place by 1970) have simplified some\naspects of the original proof over the decades.\n  This simplified approach works equally well for all values of the genus $g$,\nremoving the restriction $g\\ge 2$ in the 1965 original. Finally, we comment\nthat such a logarithmic reformulation extends to related kinds of bundles such\nas principal bundles with reductive structure groups or parabolic bundles."}

If the connection is tame at finite\ndistance and untwisted at infinity, the diagram is actually a graph,\ncorresponding to a symmetric generalised Cartan matrix, and it was proved by\nBoalch/Hiroe-Yamakawa that the corresponding nonabelian Hodge moduli space\ncontains the Nakajima quiver variety of the graph as an open subset. In this\nnote, we show that there exist new nonabelian Hodge diagrams that are graphs,\nbeyond the setting of this quiver modularity theorem. The proof relies on\nobserving that edge multiplicities in nonabelian Hodge diagrams satisfy\nultrametric inequalities, which in particular gives a precise characterisation\nof nonabelian Hodge graphs coming from the untwisted setting."}
