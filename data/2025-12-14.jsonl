The result is obtained for the Poisson transform studied by Knapp-Wallach under the name Szegö map, and the appropriate Sobolev spaces are defined using van Erp-Yuncken's Heisenberg calculus. The proof generalizes to show that commutators of this Poisson transform with smooth functions on the Furstenberg compactification are compact. This proves the remaining open conjecture in Julg's seminal program to establish the Baum-Connes conjecture for closed subgroups of semisimple Lie groups of real rank one."}

Using Rivin's variational characterization of ideal polyhedra, we develop efficient algorithms for checking combinatorial realizability and finding volume-maximizing configurations. Our systematic computational study reveals two striking phenomena: (1) maximal volume ideal polyhedra consistently exhibit dihedral angles that are rational multiples of $π$ -- a property with no obvious explanation from the optimization formulation; and (2) the distribution of volumes for random configurations is well-approximated by a Beta distribution, with mean normalized volume converging to approximately $\\ln 2 \\approx 0.69$ as the vertex count increases. We provide complete data for small vertex counts, including vertex positions, triangulations, and verified rational angle structures. An interactive implementation is publicly available."}

Calegari--Dunfield proved that every taut foliation of an atoroidal $3$-manifold $M$ has a universal circle, but the uniqueness (or lack-thereof) of this structure remains rather mysterious.\n  In this paper, we consider the foliations associated to an Anosov flow $\\varphi$ on $M$, showing that several constructions of a universal circle in the literature are typically distinct. Moreover, the underlying action of the Calegari--Dunfield leftmost universal circle is generally not even conjugate to the universal circle arising from the boundary of the flow space of $\\varphi$. Our primary tool is a way to use the flow space of $\\varphi$ to parameterize the circle bundle at infinity of $\\varphi$'s invariant foliations."}

Crucially, this tree bijection requires the hyperbolic surface to have at least one cusp as origin, from which point distances are measured. In this paper we will extend this tree bijection, such that having a cusp is no longer required. We will first extend the bijection to half-tight cylinders. Since general planar hyperbolic surfaces can be naturally decomposed in two half-tight cylinders, this general case is also covered. In the half-tight cylinder the distances to the origin are replaced by the so-called Busemann function. This Busemann function is not well-defined on the surface, but it is on the cylinder cover."}

This version in particular involves a geometrically distinguished $SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$ flat connection (a generalization of the standard hyperbolic flat connection to other Thurston geometries) and has a statement about the integrality of coefficients appearing in the modular transformation formula. We prove that the conjecture holds for Brieskorn homology spheres and some other examples.
