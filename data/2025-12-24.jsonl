Given a finite set ${L}$ of pairwise skew lines in $\\mathbb{P}^3_K$ and the associated groupoid $C_{L}$, we consider the endomorphism group $G_{L} \\subset \\operatorname{Aut}(L_i) \\cong \\operatorname{PGL}_2(K)$ for any line $L_i \\in {L}$, and we ask which finite subgroups of $\\operatorname{PGL}_2(K)$ can occur in this way.\n  Using a matrix description of skew lines, we express the generators of $G_{L}$ in terms of a family of matrices $M_i \\in \\operatorname{GL}_2(K)$ and analyze $G_{L}$ in the abelian and non-abelian cases. In the abelian situation we show that, after a change of basis, the matrices $M_i$ are simultaneously upper triangular and we obtain explicit families realizing cyclic groups and $p$-semi-elementary groups of the form $C_p^m \\rtimes C_n$. In the non-abelian case we prove that no dihedral group $D_n$ with $n \\ge 3$ can occur, while we construct configurations with $G_{L} \\cong A_4, S_4, A_5$ and describe their orbit structure.\n  Viewed through the lens of $(a,b)$-geproci sets, these results provide a group-theoretic description of collinearly complete point sets and yield new examples of half-grid geproci sets."}

Properties of $G$-equivariant functors are employed to show that the associated Koszul complex is a complex of $kG$-modules, and to generalize known dimension formulas to identities between virtual representations. In the case of canonical curves, explicit formulas are obtained by combining the theory of equivariant Euler characteristics and equivariant Riemann-Roch theorems with that of generating functions for Schur functors."}

This article presents an alternative proof of this theorem for a specific class of $F$-isocrystals. The central ingredient is a local extension property for étale $p$-divisible subgroups. To relate $p$-divisible groups and overconvergent $F$-isocrystals, we employ logarithmic Dieudonné theory, as introduced by Kato and further developed by Inoue. Over curves, this leads to an equivalence between the category of potentially semi-stable $p$-divisible groups and overconvergent $F$-isocrystals with slopes in the interval $[0,1]$."}

We prove that after forgetting the quantum grading, the resulting doubly-graded invariant of positive torus knots grows exactly exponentially in the color, resolving a 2013 conjecture of Gorsky--Gukov--Stošić.

We begin by introducing the notion of $h$-special varieties, which can be seen as varieties \"chain-connected by the Zariski closures of entire curves.\" We prove that if $X$ is either a special complex quasi-projective variety in the sense of Campana or an $h$-special variety, then for any linear representation $\\varrho:π_1(X)\\to \\mathrm{GL}_N(\\mathbb{C})$, the image $\\varrho(π_1(X))$ is virtually nilpotent. We also provide examples showing that this result is sharp, leading to a revised form of Campana's abelianity conjecture for smooth quasi-projective varieties. In addition, we prove a structure theorem for quasi-projective varieties with big and semisimple representations of the fundamental groups, thereby addressing a conjecture by Kollár in 1995. We also construct several examples of quasi-projective varieties that are special and $h$-special, highlighting certain atypical properties of the non-compact case in contrast with the projective setting."}

Within this framework, we reinterpret classical arithmetic notions - such as the descent of varieties and of covers - and construct their topological analogues. We formalize the parallel setting between closed subgroups of the absolute Galois group and subgroups of the Mapping Class Group of a base space and their actions on fundamental groups. This provides an analogy between arithmetic and topological invariants, allowing us to define the groups of moduli, definition, and invariance in both settings.\n  Using this unified perspective, some purely group-theoretic proofs provide results in both settings simultaneously. Applications include a topological analogue of Weil's Descent Theorem for mapping class groups and an adaptation of Débes and Douai's cohomological obstructions regarding descent of algebraic covers to the topological setting.\n  Finally, we elevate these results to the categorical level. We demonstrate that the classical Weil cocycle condition is equivalent to the existence of a linearization in the language of equivariant categories. Applying this perspective to the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves $\\mathsf{D^b}(X)$, we show that the equivariant derived category $\\mathsf{D^b}(X)^G$, under the action induced by a Weil descent datum, recovers the derived category of the descended variety."}
