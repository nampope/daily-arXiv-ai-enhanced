Starting with an arbitrary\nrational $(1,1)$-class $\\alpha\\in H^{1,1}(X,\\mathbb{Q})$, we algorithmically\nbuild a one-parameter family of quartic $K3$'s acquiring at most ten\n$A_1$-nodes. On the central fibre $\\widetilde{X}_0$, the class $\\alpha$\nspecializes to a $\\mathbb{Q}$-linear combination of the hyperplane class and\nthe exceptional $(-2)$-curves coming from the blow-ups of the nodes. Using the\nClemens--Schmid sequence together with Picard--Lefschetz theory, we identify\n$\\Gr^W_2 H^2_{\\lim}\\cong H^2(\\widetilde{X}_0)$ and transport this combination\nback to the original smooth surface as an algebraic divisor. This yields an\nexplicit, finite-step procedure that realizes any rational $(1,1)$-class by an\nalgebraic cycle. We also formulate an equivariant extension for $(2,2)$-classes\non Calabi--Yau threefolds, indicating how the same strategy might apply in\nhigher dimension."}

When the boundary of $M$\nis incompressible, the renormalized volume is always positive, otherwise there\nare sequences of convex co-compact structures on $M$ whose renormalized volumes\ndiverge to minus infinity.\n  We define here a new version of the renormalized volume which adapts to the\ncompressible boundary case, satisfying properties analogous to those of the\nclassical one in the incompressible setting. In particular, the adapted\nrenormalized volume is bounded from below, its differential has uniformly\nbounded supremum norm, and its gradient has uniformly bounded Weil-Petersson\nnorm. Moreover, it stays at uniformly bounded distance from the convex core\nvolume function. As a corollary, we obtain a bound on the convex core volume of\nhandlebodies in terms of the Weil-Petersson distance from a subset of the\nTeichm\\\"uller space. Furthermore, the adapted renormalized volume extends\ncontinuously, as a function on the Teichm\\\"uller space of $\\partial\\bar M$, to\nthe strata in the boundary of its Weil-Petersson completion corresponding to\ncompressible multicurves. We provide a geometric interpretation of the limit\nquantity by defining a renormalized volume, and its adapted version, for convex\nco-compact hyperbolic $3$-manifolds with a finite set of marked points in the\nboundary."}
