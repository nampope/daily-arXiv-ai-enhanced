More generally, we explain how the hierarchical hull of a pair of points in any colorable hierarchically hyperbolic space is quasi-isometric to a finite CAT(0) cube complex of bounded dimension, with the added property that perturbing the pair of points results in a uniformly bounded change to the cubical structure. Our approach is simplified and new in many aspects."}

We thus account for Higgs bundles, Hodge filtrations and hyperkähler rotations of local systems. In particular, our constructions are shown to decompose a hyperholomorphic sheaf theory of so-called BBB-branes into cuspidal and Eisenstein components. Our work is motivated, on the one hand, by the `classical limit' or `Dolbeault geometric Langlands conjecture' of Donagi and Pantev, and on the other, by attempts to interpret Kapustin and Witten's physical duality between BBB-branes and BAA-branes in 4D supersymmetric Yang--Mills theories as a mathematical statement within the geometric Langlands program."}

Although the tropical count is infinite, tropical tritangents come in 15 equivalence classes, each containing the tropicalization of exactly eight classical tritangents.\n  Under mild genericity conditions on the tropical side, we show that liftings of tropical tritangents are defined over quadratic extensions of the ground field over which the input sextic curve is defined. When the input curve is real, we prove that every complex liftable member of a given tropical tritangent class either completely lifts to the reals or none of its liftings are defined over the reals. As our main application we use these methods to build examples of real space sextics with 64 and 120 totally real tritangents, respectively.

Our notion of primitivity is defined modulo a certain integral domain, it is weaker than the classical definition of primitivity. We obtain also a generalization of the complete Poincaré duality over a certain integral domain to hypersurfaces obtained by patchworkings which are primitive modulo this integral domain.
