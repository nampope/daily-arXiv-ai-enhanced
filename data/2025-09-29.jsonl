The clock theorem implies that clock states of a knotoid\ndiagram form a lattice under transpositions. These states form the basis of\nmany invariants of knotoids and linkoids including the Alexander polynomial,\nMock Alexander polynomial and the Jones polynomial."}

Under a mild assumption on the behaviour of\nHodge numbers under reduction modulo $p$, we prove that the existence of a\nnon-zero global 2-form on $X$ implies the existence of $p$-torsion Brauer\nclasses with surjective evaluation map, after a finite extension of $K$. This\nimplies that any smooth proper variety over a number field which satisfies weak\napproximation over all finite extensions has no non-zero global 2-form. The\nproof is based on a prismatic interpretation of Brauer classes with eventually\nconstant evaluation, and a Newton-above-Hodge result for the mod $p$ reduction\nof prismatic cohomology. This generalises work of Bright and the second-named\nauthor beyond the ordinary reduction case."}

We apply our algorithm to examples of cubics with a symplectic\nautomorphism. In particular, we prove that a general cubic with a symplectic\ninvolution has 1120 non-trivial Fourier-Mukai partners, each admitting an\nEckardt involution, and all birational. As a corollary, we prove that admitting\na symplectic automorphism is not a Fourier-Mukai invariant for cubic fourfolds."}
