We study that approach for knots and arcs on a standard torus in the 3-sphere. We prove that each nontrivial torus knot union an essential arc is a prime theta-curve. By comparing the constituent knots of those theta-curves, we obtain infinitely many prime theta-curves. We then classify all theta-curves that lie on a standard torus. In particular, Kinoshita's theta-curve does not lie on a standard torus."}

When Γ is the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold M, X(Γ) turns out to\n  be a powerful tool in the study of the geometry and topology of M. Chinburg-Reid-Stover have\n  borrowed tools from algebraic and arithmetic geometry to understand algebraic and number-theoretic\n  properties of the canonical curves of X(Γ).

Here we build one example where the monodromy is a \"pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism\" of the 4-dimensional fiber, in a way that is surprisingly similar to the familiar and beautiful two-dimensional picture of Nielsen and Thurston for surfaces. This fact has various consequences:\n  (1) There is a compact smooth 4-manifold $M$ such that no non-trivial class in $H_2(M)$ is represented by immersed tori, and infinitely many classes are represented by smoothly embedded genus two surfaces.\n  (2) There is a compact locally CAT(0) space $Y$ such that $π_1(Y)$ is not hyperbolic and does not contain $\\mathbb Z \\times \\mathbb Z$.\n  The latter answers a question of Gromov, known as the Closing Flat Problem."}

In this paper, motivated by work in \\cite{CN}, we think of two-periodic elliptic helices as noncommutative analogues of degree two line bundles over $X$. We classify and study two-periodic elliptic helices in order to generalize the theory of double covers of $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$ by $X$ to the noncommutative setting. This leads to the following problem: given an integer $d>2$ and a real number $θ\\in \\mathbb{Q}+\\mathbb{Q}\\sqrt{d^2-4}$, classify elliptic helices inducing double covers of $\\mathbb{P}^{1}_{d}$ by ${\\sf C}^θ$, where $\\mathbb{P}^{1}_{d}$ is Piontkovski's noncommutative projective line and ${\\sf C}^θ$ is Polischuk's noncommutative elliptic curve. We find examples of $d$ and $θ$ such that there is essentially one numerical class of elliptic helices and examples of $d$ and $θ$ such that there are several distinct numerical classes of elliptic helices, in contrast to the commutative situation."}

We show the existence of an explicit constant $K_δ$, depending only on the hyperbolicity constant $δ$ of the space, such that the hyperbolicity of the images of primitive elements together with the finiteness of the set of (conjugacy classes of) primitive elements whose images have lengths bounded by $K_δ$ imply a linear growth of the lengths with respect to the word length on primitive elements. We give several characterizations of Bowditch representations, and the framework developed allows us to prove that they form an open domain of discontinuity in the character variety. As a corollary, we also obtain a new characterization of primitive-stable representations, introduced by Minsky. Finally, we explain how our results can be used to obtain finite certificate for the recognition of Bowditch representations."}
