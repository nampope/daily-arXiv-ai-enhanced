In this work, we investigate the symmetric case-namely,\nsymmetric persistent tensors, or equivalently, persistent polynomials. We\nestablish that a symmetric tensor in $\\mathrm{Sym}^n \\mathbb{C}^d$ is\npersistent if the determinant of its Hessian equals the $d(n-2)$-th power of a\nnonzero linear form. The converse is verified for cubic tensors ($n=3$) or for\n$d \\leq 3$, by leveraging classical results of B. Segre. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that the Hessian of a symmetric persistent tensor factors as the\n$d$-th power of a form of degree $(n-2)$. Our main results provide an explicit\nnecessary and sufficient criterion for persistence, thereby offering an\neffective algebraic characterization of this class of tensors. Beyond\ncharacterization, we present normal forms in small dimensions, place persistent\npolynomials within prehomogeneous geometry, and connect them with\nsemi-invariants, homaloidal polynomials, and Legendre transforms.
