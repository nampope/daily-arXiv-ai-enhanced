If a string link\nis the product of some string link diagram $T$ and the parallel n-cable of a\nframed long knot diagram $D$, then there is a canonical arc $push$ in $M_n$,\ndefined by pushing $T$ through the n-cable of $D$. In this paper we apply the\ncombinatorial 1-cocycles from the HOMFLYPT and Kauffman polynomials in $M_n$\nwith values in the corresponding skein modules to this canonical arc in $M_n$.\nSome of the 1-cocycles lead to linear systems of equations in the skein\nmodules, for each couple of diagrams $D$ and $D'$. If the system has no\nsolution in the Laurent polynomials then $D$ and $D'$ represent different\nknots. We give first examples where we distinguish knots without any knot\ninvariants. In particular, we distinguish the knot $9_{42}$ from its mirror\nimage with equations coming from the HOMFLYPT polynomial. Notice that the knot\n$9_{42}$ and its mirror image share the same HOMFLYPT polynomial.\n  On the other hand, each solution of the system gives rather fine information\nabout any regular isotopy which connects $D$ with $D'$."}
