We show that the\ncurve $C$ has a model over an algebraic extension of $K$ whose special fiber\nconsists of genus-$0$ components and has at worst nodal singularities if and\nonly if the cluster data of the roots of $f$ satisfies a certain criterion, and\nwhen these hold, we show explicitly how to build the minimal regular model of\n$C$. We develop an interpretation of cluster data in terms of a convex hull in\nthe Berkovich projective line and express the above results directly in terms\nof this convex hull."}

It is further shown that relative limit measures converge along\ngeodesic rays, providing a result on the d_p-radial geometry of graded norms,\nanalogous to a recent result of Finski in the Archimedean case."}

A crucial method that we establish is the extension of the\nconcept of `code shortening' to the case of generalized codes: this is the\nalgebraic counterpart of the geometric notion of a partial smoothing of the\nsingular points, and leads to the concept of ancestors, which we illustrate\nthrough several examples."}
