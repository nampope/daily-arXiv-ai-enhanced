In many instances, when mathematicians are using techniques on\ntopological manifolds that appear to be Morse-theoretic in nature, there is a\ntopological Morse function implicit in the argument. Topological Morse\nfunctions are known to inherit most of the familiar properties of the usual\n(smooth) Morse functions, with two crucial exceptions: existence and\ndeformability. This paper gives a simple construction of continuous families of\ntopological Morse functions."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "In our earlier work on $2$-torsion in instanton Floer homology, we considered\nonly integral surgeries on a knot $K\\subset S^3$ and showed that the absence of\n$2$-torsion forces $K$ to be fibered. The present paper extends the result to\nall rational surgeries. We prove that if the framed instanton homology\n$I^{\\sharp}(S^3_r(K);\\mathbb{Z})$ is $2$-torsion-free for some $r\\in\n\\mathbb{Q}_+$, then $K$ is an instanton L-space knot and $r>2g(K)-1$.\nLeveraging this $2$-torsion perspective, we also obtain new small-surgery\nobstructions: If either $S^{3}_{5}(K)$ or $S^{3}_{11/2}(K)$ is $SU(2)$-abelian,\nthen $K$ must be the unknot or the right-handed trefoil. This result sharpens\nthe small-$SU(2)$-abelian surgery theorems of Kronheimer--Mrowka,\nBaldwin--Sivek, and Baldwin--Li--Sivek--Ye."}
