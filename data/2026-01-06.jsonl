A probabilistic analogue of this theorem for real roots of real polynomials, sometimes referred to as the Kac theorem, was found between 1938 and 1943 by J. Littlewood, A. Offord, and M. Kac. In this paper, we present several more versions of FTA: Kac type FTA for Laurent polynomials in one and many variables, Kac type FTA for polynomials on complex reductive groups arising in the context of compact group representations (similar to Laurent polynomials arising in torus representation theory), and FTA for exponential sums in one and many variables. In the case of Laurent polynomials, the result, even in the one-dimensional case, is unexpected: most of the zeros of a real Laurent polynomial are real. This text is a supplemented and more detailed version of \\cite{arx}."}

Given a smooth proper geometrically connected scheme $X$ over a field $k$ of characteristic 0 and a base point $x \\in X(k)$, one can define its differential fundamental group $π^{\\mathrm{diff}}(X/k)$, which comes from the Tannakian duality of the category of coherent integrable connections on $X$. Using the formalism of $δ$-functor, one can define natural morphisms between the group-scheme cohomology of $π^{\\mathrm{diff}}(X/k)$ and the de Rham cohomology of $X$. One says that $X$ with $x \\in X(k)$ is de Rham $K(π,1)$ if such morphisms are all isomorphisms. In this article, we prove that abelian varieties in characteristic 0 are de Rham $K(π,1)$.

We describe the relation to the Quot scheme by proving that the Bilinear functor can be realized as a closed subfunctor of a product of Quot schemes, hence the Bilinear functor is representable by a closed subscheme of the product of Quot schemes. We use this result to compute the tangent space to the Bilinear scheme representing $\\mathrm{Bilin}_{d_1,d_2,d_3}^{r_1, r_2}(\\mathbb{A}^n)$.
