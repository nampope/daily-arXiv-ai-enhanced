First, we introduce a new tool that enables us to characterize\nthe property of being plus--one generated within the class of conic\narrangements with some naturally chosen quasi--homogeneous singularities. Next,\nwe present a classification result on plus--one generated conic arrangements\nadmitting only nodes and tacnodes as singularities. Building on results\nregarding conic arrangements with nodes and tacnodes, we present new examples\nof strong Ziegler pairs of conic-line arrangements -- that is, arrangements\nhaving the same strong combinatorics but distinct derivation modules."}

We classify the linear degenerations of\n(partial) flag varieties that are smooth. Furthermore, we study the singular\nlocus of irreducible degenerations and provide estimates for its dimension. We\nalso introduce a new stratification of the total space of representations.\nWithin each stratum, we identify the loci corresponding to flat and flat\nirreducible degenerations. As a consequence of our results, we show that\nirreducible linear degenerations are normal varieties."}

It was introduced by De\nMari-Procesi-Shayman in 1992 and has been actively studied in this decade. In\nparticular, unexpected relations to hyperplane arrangements and the\nStanley-Stembridge conjecture in graph theory have been discovered. Hessenberg\nvarieties can be defined in partial flag varieties. In this paper, we study\ntheir cohomology by relating them to the cohomology of Hessenberg varieties in\nthe full flag varieties."}

We start with their definition and some fundamental results\nsuch as Gabrielov's Complement Theorem or existence of cell decompositions. We\nthen give the main basic tools of subanalytic geometry, such as Curve Selection\nLemma, Lojasiewicz's inequalities, existence of tubular neighborhood, Tamm's\ntheorem (definability of regular points), or existence of regular\nstratifications (Whitney or Verdier). We then present the developments of\nLipschitz geometry obtained by various authors during the four last decades,\ngiving a proof of existence of metric triangulations, introduced by the author\nof these notes, definable bi-Lipschitz triviality, Lipschitz conic structure,\nas well as invariance of the link under definable bi-Lipschitz mappings. The\nlast chapter is devoted to geometric integration theory, studying the Hausdorff\nmeasure of globally subanalytic sets, integrals of subanalytic functions, as\nwell as the density of subanalytic sets (the Lelong number) and Stokes'\nformula."}

A knot is said to be twist positive if it\nadmits a positive braid representative that contains at least one full twist.\nMotivated by a conjecture of Krishna and Morton, we investigate this\nrelationship via the knot Floer torsion order. As a consequence, we show that\nthe bridge index and the braid index coincide for all twist positive knots."}
