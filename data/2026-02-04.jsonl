For a measure $μ$, this quantity, denoted by $Γ(μ)$, is defined as the supremum of the $μ$-perimeter over all convex bodies and measures the largest possible boundary contribution of convex sets with respect to $μ$. Let $$Γ_n := \\sup\\{Γ(μ) : μ\\text{ is an isotropic log-concave probability measure on } \\mathbb{R}^n\\}.$$ We prove that $Γ_n \\leqslant Cn^{3/2}$, where $C>0$ is an absolute constant. This result improves the previously known $O(n^2)$ upper bound. Under additional structural assumptions, we obtain sharp linear bounds of order $O(n)$."}

Paolo Ghiggini and Yi Ni showed that knot Floer homology detects fibered knots. Their results imply, in particular, that grid diagrams with a unique grid state whose Alexander grading is maximal only exist for fibered knots. Whether every fibered knot admits such a diagram remains an open question. Here, we investigate the existence of such special grid diagrams for fibered knots. We develop an efficient method for deciding whether a given grid diagram meets the even stricter condition of having a unique grid state that realizes an upper bound for the Alexander function. By implementing this method in a Python package, we find suitable grid diagrams for 5385 of the 5397 fibered prime knots with crossing number at most 13."}

Topological data analysis (TDA) provides a solution via persistent homology, which encodes features of interest as topological holes within a filtration of data. The present work extends this framework to a related invariant which uncovers topological structure of a space relative to a subspace: persistent relative homology (PRH). We show that this invariant can be computed in a simple, highly transparent and general manner, using a two-step matrix reduction technique with worst-case time complexity comparable to ordinary persistent homology. We provide proofs demonstrating the correctness and computational complexity of this approach in addition to a performance-optimized implementation for a special case."}
