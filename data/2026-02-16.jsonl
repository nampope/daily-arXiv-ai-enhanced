We study properties of monoids and modules in $Λ$-sequences under the Kelly monoidal structure. In particular, we show that the forgetful functor from right modules in $Λ$-sequences to right modules in symmetric sequences is an isomorphism. We show that any compatible lower data extends to a normal oplax monoidal structure and use this to establish a universal normal oplax monoidal structure on $Λ$-sequences extending the Kelly product, identifying unital operads to monoids in unital $Λ$-sequences for a general symmetric monoidal category $\\mathscr{V}$. We also establish a closed monoidal localization theorem."}

We show that any $\\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-equivariant triangulation of a small cover naturally induces a triangulation of the orbit space. Then, we explicitly construct the minimal $\\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-equivariant triangulation of $\\mathbb{RP}^3$, which contains $11$ vertices and prove that this is the unique $\\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-equivariant triangulation of $\\mathbb{RP}^3$ with $11$ vertices. For a finite group $G$, we give a method for constructing some $G$-equivariant triangulations of connected sums of manifolds from their respective $G$-equivariant triangulations. In particular, we construct a $\\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-equivariant triangulation of $\\mathbb{RP}^3 \\# \\mathbb{RP}^3$ with $17$ vertices, which is the best known yet. This triangulation of $\\mathbb{RP}^3 \\# \\mathbb{RP}^3$ provides another minimal $g$-vector improving one of the result of Lutz in \\cite{LS}. Moreover, we prove that a $\\ZZ_2^4$-equivariant triangulation of $\\mathbb{RP}^4$ requires at least $18$ vertices."}

Although this does not directly establish that the augmentation polynomial of a knot is the classical limit of a deformed $\\hat{A}$-polynomial -- as suggested by Aganagić and Vafa -- it reduces the problem to characterizing certain algebraic properties of a module over the quantum torus, introduced in work of Gaiotto, Kannagi, and Sanjurjo. We term this the \\emph{HOMFLYPT difference module}, which captures relations between the colored HOMFLYPT polynomials of different antisymmetric colorings. We demonstrate that the classical limit of this difference module for a knot is precisely the degree 0 abelianized knot contact homology of the knot, and we provide a natural extension of this result to links."}

The question of the existence of global ribbon minima in each concordance class is a generalization of the slice-ribbon conjecture, which asserts that the unknot is the global minimum in its class. We show that the (reduced rational) Khovanov homology of the (4,5) torus knot is a summand in the Khovanov homology of any knot in its concordance class."}
