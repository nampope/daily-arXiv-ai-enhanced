This is done entirely in the language of $SU(2)$ representations, differential topology and elementary algebraic topology. It avoids the Narasimhan-Seshadri correspondence, clarifying the nature of Lagrangian immersions into $χ(F_2)$ induced by 3-manifolds with genus two boundary. We give examples of such Lagrangian immersions and describe a correspondence from multicurves in the pillowcase to Lagrangian immersions in $χ(F_2)$, induced by a 2-stranded tangle in a punctured genus 2 handlebody. We give an example of a non-transverse pair of smooth Lagrangians in $χ(F_2)$ induced by a genus 2 Heegaard splitting of $(S^3,W)$ for the ``linked eyeglasses\" web $W$, which are made transverse, and hence the corresponding Chern-Simons function Morse, using Goldman flows/holonomy perturbations along embedded curves in the Heegaard surface."}

We call such knots $\\mathcal{X}$-large and introduce two diagrammatic constructions that produce $\\mathcal{X}$-large knots. The first construction uses split link diagrams and rational tangle replacements, providing a topological explanation for most $\\mathcal{X}$-large knots observed in knot tables. The second construction is based on braids and orientation-reversing involutions, and is motivated by a detailed analysis of the knot $10_{123}$, also known as the Turk's head knot $Th(3,5)$. In particular, this approach applies to Turk's head knots $Th(p,q)$ with $p$ and $q$ odd, leading us to conjecture that all such knots are $\\mathcal{X}$-large. In doing so, we also present a non-orientable analogue of Thurston's theorem giving a lower bound on the dimension of character varieties of non-orientable 3-manifolds."}

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "The motivic hit problem seeks a minimal generating set for the motivic cohomology of classifying spaces as a module over the motivic Steenrod algebra. In this paper, we provide a complete structural classification of the hit image within the top layer of Kameko's decomposition, revealing a rigidity phenomenon governed by parity. Specifically, for degrees $d=k+2d_1$ with $d_1=(n-1)(2^k-1)$, let $V$ denote the span of the monotone translates of Kameko's monomial $z_k$. We prove that the intersection of $V$ with the hit subspace is exactly the even-parity hyperplane. Consequently, the quotient $V/(\\text{hits})$ is one-dimensional and is generated by any odd-parity linear combination of these translates. This establishes the \"odd-parity gap\" as the precise obstruction to the hit property in this layer. As an arithmetic consequence of this structural result, we identify a new infinite numerical family with $n=2^r+1$ and $k=n-4$ ($r\\ge 5$) where $β(d)>n$. This yields a new class of counterexamples to the motivic Peterson-type conjecture, distinct from Kameko's original family. Furthermore, we show that these structural results and counterexamples persist over any algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$."}

Therefore, some conclusions about continuity of Sobolev mappings on Carnot groups for $p<ν$ are found. And also, the determine of horizontal gradient $D_Hf$ is invariant under the motion related to higher layer left-invariant vector fields. At last, we find a equivalent definition of quasiconformal mappings with lower integrability $dim(g^{[1]})<p<ν$."}
