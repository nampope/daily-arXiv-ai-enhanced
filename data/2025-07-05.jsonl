Namely, we construct twisted Higgs\nbundles from a finite covering map and a vector bundle on that covering but\nwithout requiring that they match the eigen-data for some fixed twisted Higgs\nbundle. We investigate stability for twisted Higgs bundles constructed in this\nway, and compare our covering data to that of the traditional spectral cover."}
