In this\npaper, we prove that every negative amphichiral link whose amphichiral map\npreserves each component is rationally slice. Our proof relies on a systematic\nanalysis of the action induced by the negative amphichiral map on the JSJ\ndecomposition of the link exterior. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions\non such an action to deduce when a negative amphichiral knot is either isotopic\nto, or concordant to, a strongly negative amphichiral knot.
