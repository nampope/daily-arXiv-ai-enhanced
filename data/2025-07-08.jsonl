We introduce a\nmodification of the Goeritz method that generalizes the Goeritz matrix for\ncomputing the HOMFLY-PT polynomials for any $N$ in the special case of\nbipartite links. Our method reduces to purely algebraic operations on matrices,\nand therefore, it can be easily implemented as a computer program. Bipartite\nlinks form a rather large family including a special class of Montesinos links\nconstructed from the so-called rational tangles. We demonstrate how to obtain a\nbipartite diagram of such links and calculate the corresponding HOMFLY-PT\npolynomials using our developed generalized Goeritz method."}

This is done by introducing a new technique to the study of cables based\non Legendrian surgeries."}

This paper introduces a\nnovel approach to investigate this conjecture by generalizing the concept of\nZernike moments through the lens of harmonic analysis and spectral geometry.\nOur core idea involves defining a ``characteristic form'' $\\eta_Z$ for a Hodge\ncycle $Z$ within a K\\\"ahler variety $X$, and expanding this form in terms of\nthe eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $Z$. We hypothesize that\nfor algebraic Hodge cycles, the coefficients of this spectral expansion (termed\n``spectral fingerprints'') will exhibit specific algebraic patterns, such as\nbeing rational numbers, algebraic numbers, or algebraic functions of moduli\nparameters. We illustrate the computational methodology with a simplified ``toy\nmodel'' using a characteristic function on a torus, demonstrating how such\ncoefficients can indeed be rational in a controlled setting. We then outline a\nconceptual framework for applying this approach to more complex scenarios,\nspecifically K3 surfaces, by leveraging the theory of variations of Hodge\nstructures and moduli spaces to define ``dynamic characteristic forms'' and\nanalyze the algebraic nature of their coefficients. This framework promises to\nopen new avenues in understanding the Hodge Conjecture by translating a deep\ngeometric problem into a question about the algebraic properties of spectral\ndata."}
