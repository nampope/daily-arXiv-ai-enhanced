Moreno-Fernández", "Bruno Stonek"], "title": "Algebraic models for equivariant rational homotopy theory for discrete groups", "comment": null, "summary": "We provide a framework which generalizes algebraic models of a homotopy theory of spaces to the genuine equivariant case for a discrete group. We explain how this applies to commutative differential graded algebra (cdga) models and complete differential graded Lie algebra models for rational spaces. We compare the cdga model to other model categories in the literature."}

We introduce a `generalized symplectic quandle structure' corresponding to ($\\mathcal{D}_M$, conjugation) for each $M\\in\\mathbb C\\setminus \\{0,1,-1\\}$, where $\\mathcal{D}_M=\\{A\\in SL(2,\\mathbb{C})\\mid tr(A)= M+M^{-1} \\}$. By converting the system of conjugation quandle equations to that of generalized symplectic quandle equations, we obtain a simpler expression for the 2-variable Riley polynomial and derive some recursive formulas for Riley polynomials and Alexander polynomials. This approach enables us to effectively compute the A-polynomials, allowing us to obtain numerous previously unknown A-polynomials within minutes using Mathematica."}

We discuss a couple of other specific settings of interest that are accommodated by our generalization."}

We prove that these $q$-series depend only on the class of the link in the skein module, thereby defining a homomorphism from the skein module to the space of $q$-series. The image of this homomorphism is conjectured to be holomorphically quantum modular, which suggests a new approach to Langlands duality for skein modules through $q$-series."}

The key construction is the halo of a cell, which contains all those faces in the boundary that enter closed sublevelsets precisely when the threshold reaches that cell's value. The complement of this halo in the boundary, called the shadow, is always a subcomplex. A stratified discrete Morse function requires Forman's conditions on each stratum together with the requirement that closures of paired cells admit filtered collapses onto their shadows. We establish fundamental Morse lemmas: filtered collapses across regular intervals, and controlled attachments at critical values. For functions satisfying only the stratum-wise Forman condition, we construct an upper envelope on the barycentric subdivision whose local Morse data decomposes into horizontal and vertical components. This yields a simplicial analogue of the standard tangential-normal splitting of local Morse data in the sense of Goresky and MacPherson."}

Unfortunately, there are no sufficiently good algebraic models for framed Fulton-MacPherson modules that would allow us to explicitly describe the rational homotopy type of the embedding space. Recently there were several attempts to avoid dealing with the framed versions of Fulton-MacPherson modules by considering framed manifolds, e.g. embeddings modulo immersions $\\overline{\\mathrm{Emb}}$ in a recent paper by Fresse, Turchin and Willwacher, or embeddings with a deformation of the framing $\\widetilde{\\mathrm{Emb}}$ in a recent paper by the author. In both cases, the rational homotopy type of the corresponding embedding space has an explicit description in terms of graphs (hairy graph complexes).\n  We construct a combinatorial graphical composition for the composition of embedding spaces $\\widetilde{\\mathrm{Emb}}$. As a step on our way, we describe the action of the coinduction functor on configuration-space-type $e_n^c$-comodules."}
