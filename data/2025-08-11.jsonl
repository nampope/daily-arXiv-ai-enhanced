Our approach extends the\ninfinite-dimensional transversality framework of Daskalopoulos-Uhlenbeck and\nWilkin to this general GIT setting. Central to our method is the construction\nof a G-equivariant holomorphic vector bundle over the conjugation orbit of a\none-parameter subgroup (1-PS), whose fibres are precisely the negative weight\nspaces determining instability. A key proposition establishes that a naturally\ndefined evaluation map is transverse to the zero section of this bundle,\nimplying that generic homotopies avoid all unstable and strictly semistable\nstrata under certain dimensional inequalities.\n  Our result also covers cases where semistability does not coincide with\nstability. The applicability of this framework is illustrated by several\nexamples. For the 2-Kronecker quiver, our conclusions precisely match the known\ntopology of the stable locus. In linear control theory, where GIT stability\ncorresponds to the notion of controllability, our results determine the\nconnectivity of the space of controllable systems. In statistical modelling,\nwhere stability for star-shaped Gaussian model corresponds to the existence of\na unique Maximum Likelihood Estimate, we compute the connectivity of the space\nof data samples that yield such a unique estimate, providing topological\ninsight into the problem of parameter non-identifiability."}

We give a unified characterisation of slope\ndetection, and conjecture that the relative $L$-space conjecture is equivalent\nto the $L$-space conjecture for toroidal manifolds. We confirm this equivalence\nfor the properties $CTF$ and $NLS$.\n  Much of our technical work lies in proving that the set of $CTF$-detected\nslopes on $\\partial M$ is a finite union of possibly degenerate closed\nintervals with rational endpoints; in particular, it is closed in the space of\nslopes. This involves generalizing results of Tao Li on laminar branched\nsurfaces to the setting of manifolds with boundary.\n  Within the slopes detected by co-orientable taut foliations, we identify a\nspecial subset, which we call exceptional $CTF$-detected slopes. This set\nincludes $CTF$-detected slopes whose associated Dehn fillings don't admit\nco-orientable taut foliations. We believe this exceptional set is important to\nunderstand. In this article, we show that the set of exceptional slopes is\nfinite. However, many questions remain open.\n  Finally, in the last section of the article we provide a structured synthesis\nof previous work in the area."}
