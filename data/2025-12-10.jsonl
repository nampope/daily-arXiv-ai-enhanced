For a finitely generated projective module associated to any piecewise cleft principal comodule algebra, we provide an explicit formula computing the clutching $K_1$-class in terms of the representation matrix defining the module. Thus, the module is determined by an explicit Milnor idempotent. We apply this new tool to the K-theory of quantum complex projective planes to determine their $K_0$-generators in terms of modules associated to noncommutative Hopf fibrations. On the other hand, using explicit homotopy between unitaries, we express the $K_0$-class of the Milnor idempotents in terms of elementary projections in the Toeplitz C*-algebra. This allows us to infer that all our generators are in the positive cone of the $K_0$-group, which is a purely quantum phenomenon absent in the classical case."}

When the locality parameter is $r=3$, we obtain a sharp bound on the minimum distance of the codes. In that case, we give a geometric interpretation of our codes in terms of doubly elliptic surfaces.
