Comments are very welcome", "summary": "Given a smooth projective variety $X$ with a smooth anticanonical divisor\n$D$, we study mirror symmetry for the log Calabi--Yau pair $(X,D)$ without\nassuming that $D$ is nef. We consider the mirror proper Landau--Ginzburg model\n$(\\check X,W)$ from the intrinsic mirror construction of Gross--Siebert. We\nexamine the relationship between the regularized quantum period of $X$ and the\nclassical period of $W$, and identify the discrepancy between them as\noriginating from curve counts in $D$, governed by the mirror map associated\nwith $D$. We also obtain an explicit formula for the proper potential $W$ that\nencodes this discrepancy. In the end, we show that the quantum period, together\nwith the mirror map, gives exactly the same information as the proper\npotential."}

We are guided by the following question: is it true that\nif a finite group $G$ faithfully acts on a rationally connected variety of\ndimension $n$, then $G$ can faithfully act on a terminal Fano variety of\ndimension $n$? Using algebraic methods, we prove that up to dimension $4$,\nabelian extensions of finite abelian subgroups of the Cremona group coincide\nwith direct products of such subgroups, with one exception. This result implies\na positive answer to the above question up to dimension $4$ in the case of\nfinite abelian groups, modulo a conjectural description of finite abelian\nsubgroups of $\\mathrm{Bir}(X)$ where $X$ is a rationally connected threefold."}

We begin with an\noverview of the various simplicial complexes associated with a surface (such as\nthe curve, arc, and pants complexes) and explain how to relate the dynamics of\nthe action of a given pseudo-Anosov on any one of these complexes to the\ndynamics of the diffeomorphism itself, or to the hyperbolic geometry of its\nmapping torus. We next cover some of the more modern features of the theory by\ndiscussing various analogs of pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms on surfaces of\ninfinite type. We conclude with a description of original work-- due jointly to\nthe author with Dave Futer and Sam Taylor-- that relates the action of a\npseudo-Anosov on the curve complex to the minimum number of fixed points for\nany map in the corresponding isotopy class. The paper is written in as\naccessible a way as possible while assuming only the bare minimum in\nbackground. The hope is to informally convey to the reader some of the main\nideas and strategies in the area."}
