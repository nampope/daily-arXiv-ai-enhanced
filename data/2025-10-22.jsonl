Deligne, A. B. Goncharov,\nand M. Levine, which were limited to ordinary basepoints or to specific\nvarieties. Given a smooth variety over a field endowed with a simple normal\ncrossings divisor, we encode its tangential basepoints using the language of\nlogarithmic geometry. Building on the recent construction by F. Binda, D. Park,\nand P. A. {\\O}stv{\\ae}r of a stable $\\infty$-category of\n$\\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant logarithmic motives and its comparison with the usual\n$\\infty$-category of motives, we define in a functorial manner the associated\nmotivic pointed path spaces. In the presence of a motivic $t$-structure,\ntruncating yields the motivic fundamental groupoid. In general, we construct\nBetti and de Rham realization functors for logarithmic motives (linearizing the\nconstruction of F. Binda, D. Park and P. A. {\\O}stv{\\ae}r for the Betti case)\nand we show that the periods of the motivic fundamental groupoid are given by\nregularized iterated integration of logarithmic differential $1$-forms, thus\nyielding a general version of Chen's theorem with tangential basepoints."}

Using\nthe decomposition theorem and the gluing formula from log Gromov-Witten theory,\nwe can express logarithmic cylinder counts in terms of wall type invariants. As\na corollary, we show that in the surface case the non-archimedean scattering\ndiagram from Keel-Yu and the logarithmic scattering diagram from Gross-Siebert\ncoincide, and deduce that the two mirror constructions agree. Along the way, we\nprove the exponential formula, expressing the non-archimedean wall-crossing\nfunction as the exponential of a generating series of punctured log\nGromov-Witten invariants. This provides the first explicit formula relating\ncounts of non-archimedean curves with boundary to punctured log invariants."}
