We establish their fundamental properties and show that any pair of Laurent polynomials can be realized as $(V_1(K;t),V_2(K;t))$ for some long virtual knot $K$. While these polynomials are not finite type invariants of any degree with respect to virtualizations, their first derivatives at $t=1$ define finite type invariants of degree three. As an application, we obtain an explicit Gauss diagram formula for the $α_3$-invariant."}

This construction includes the conventional $p$-metrics and generates metrics that are topologically equivalent to the conventional ones. As an application, we study fixed point and approximate fixed point properties for nonexpansive maps on a product space equipped with the constructed metric. We show that existing fixed point results of this type are consequences of our framework. Examples are provided to illustrate the established results. The construction machinery is also used to study products of length and geodesic spaces. The obtained results encompass existing ones and provide a background for potential studies of fixed point properties on these product spaces."}

This framework allows us to reduce involved topological problems to discrete problems regarding the subgroup structure and representation theory of the group $G$. Our main result is an example of this: we classify the $G$-universes $\\mathcal{U}$ for which the linear isometries operad $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{U})$ and the infinite little discs operad $\\mathcal{D}(\\mathcal{U})$ are homotopically equivalent. To achieve this, we use ideas that originate from the work of Balchin-Barnes-Roitzheim on the combinatorics of transfer systems on a total order. Additionally, the use of transfer systems gives us insight into the algebraic structures that arise from equivariant homotopy theory. Compatible pairs of transfer systems provide rules for when multiplicative transfer maps can be paired with additive transfer maps. In the case that the group $G$ is abelian, we provide conditions for when the pair $(\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{U}),\\mathcal{D}(\\mathcal{U}))$ defines a maximally compatible pair of transfer systems. As a consequence, we contribute to a recent conjecture about equivariant operad pairs."}

We demonstrate that these 2-vector bundles form a symmetric monoidal 2-stack. From this structure, we define the 2K-theory as the Grothendieck group of the internal equivalence classes of the 2-vector bundle over the given Lie groupoid, and we construct the spectra representing this theory. We then extend this framework to the equivariant setting. For any Lie groupoid equipped with an action by a coherent 2-group, we introduce the bicategory of 2-equivariant 2-vector bundles over it. This leads to the definition of 2-equivariant 2K-theory as the Grothendieck group of the internal equivalence classes in the bicategory. Furthermore, we define a higher analogue of orbifold, which generalizes Lie groupoids with a 2-group action, and construct the bicategory of 2-orbifold 2-vector bundles. Finally, we can define the 2-orbifold 2K-theory."}

We also introduce a homotopy-invariant bivariate complexity $\\mathrm{TC}_H(f,g)$ of Scott type, defined via homotopic distance, and study its relationship with the strict invariant.\n  Concrete examples reveal rigidity phenomena with no analogue in the classical case, including strict gaps between $\\mathrm{TC}(f,g)$ and $\\mathrm{TC}_H(f,g)$ and situations where synchronization becomes impossible.
