We compute the $E$-homology of tom Dieck's homotopical $A$-equivariant complex bordism spectrum $MU_A$ in two ways, correcting an error in Cole-Greenlees-Kriz (2002). Additionally, we calculate the $E$-homology of the geometric $A$-equivariant complex bordism spectrum $mU_A$."}

In general, verifying $k$-reducibility is a subtle problem. We show that the $k$-reducibility of a self-map is determine through its induced endomorphisms on homology or cohomology groups. Moreover, under the k-reducibility assumption, the computation of the homology self-closeness number of the wedge sum of spaces essentially reduces to the computation of the homology self-closeness numbers of the individual wedge summands. We generalize the notion of an atomic space to that of an $n$-atomic space and establish some of its fundamental properties. We show that the $k$-reducibility criteria for self-maps in a monoid $Å^k(X)$ is satisfied when the space $X$ decomposes as a wedge sum of distinct $n$-atomic spaces. Finally, we determine the homology self-closeness numbers of wedge sums of distinct $n$-atomic spaces."}

This allows us to establish certain categorical properties of the $\\infty$-category $Poly_{\\mathcal{S}}$, in parallel with the case of the ordinary category $Poly$. We define the notion of polynomial comonad under the monoidal structure of $Poly_{\\mathcal{S}}$ induced by composition of polynomials, and describe a construction toward exploring the connection between polynomial comonads and complete Segal spaces. This construction partially generalizes the classical one given in the proof of a theorem of Ahman-Uustalu."}

We establish that this topological space is spectral. This result follows from an analysis of the notion of nilpotence in Tamabra functors. We prove that the nilradical of a Tambara functor $T$ (the intersection of all of its prime ideals) is computed levelwise, i.e. consists precisely of the nilpotent elements in $T$. In contrast to ordinary commutative algebra, the nilpotents of $T$ are not the same as the elements $x$ such that $T[1/x] = 0$; we therefore also give a classification of these elements. As a corollary, we observe that the set of these elements in $π_\\star^s$ (the equivariant stable stems, viewed as an $\\mathrm{RO}(G)$-graded Tambara functor) forms an ideal."}

A special case of our results is that for any Lipschitz or continuous $W^{1,p}$ Sobolev map $f$ from $[0,1]^n$ into a Euclidean space with $p>n$, the image $f([0,1]^n)$ has a unique tangent set (Attouch-Wets convergence) at almost every point with respect to the $n$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. In the analogous case when $f$ is a continuous $N^{1,p}$ map from $[0,1]^n$ into a metric space, we show that the image $f([0,1]^n)$ has a unique metric tangent (Gromov-Hausdorff convergence) almost everywhere. These results complement, but are distinct from Federer's theorem on existence and uniqueness of approximate tangents of $n$-rectifiable sets in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that approximate tangents to Sobolev images can be upgraded to Attouch-Wets or Gromov-Hausdorff tangents by first proving that the $n$-packing content of Sobolev images is finite, then proving that the inability to upgrade on a set of positive measure implies infinite packing content."}

These circle polyhedra correspond to proper triangulated convex hyperbolic polyhedra in the Beltrami-Klein model $\\mathbb{B}^{3}$ of hyperbolic space with hyperideal vertices whose faces meet $\\mathbb{B}^{3}$. Although the vertices of these polyhedra lie outside $\\mathbb{B}^{3} \\cup \\mathbb{S}^{2}$ and the faces meet $\\mathbb{B}^{3}$, the edges may miss $\\mathbb{B}^{3}$ entirely, meet $\\mathbb{B}^{3}$, or, more importantly, lie tangent to $\\mathbb{B}^{3}$ at ideal points on the boundary $\\partial \\mathbb{B}^{3} = \\mathbb{S}^{2}$. The latter case is new and generalizes the global rigidity results of both Bao-Bonahon and arXiv:1703.09338. This result also generalizes the uniqueness part of the celebrated Koebe-Andre'ev-Thurston theorem to the case where adjacent circles need not touch."}
