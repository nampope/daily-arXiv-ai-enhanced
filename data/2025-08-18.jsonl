Comments welcome!", "summary": "Given a finite group action on a smooth manifold, we study the following\nquestion: if two equivariant diffeomorphisms are isotopic, must they be\nequivariantly isotopic? Birman-Hilden and Maclachlan-Harvey proved the answer\nis \"yes\" for most surfaces. By contrast, we give a general criterion in higher\ndimensions under which there are many equivariant diffeomorphisms which are\nisotopic but not equivariantly isotopic. Examples satisfying this criterion\ninclude branched covers of split links and \"stabilized\" branched covers. We\nprove the result by constructing an invariant valued in the homology of a\ncertain infinite cover of the manifold. We give applications to outer\nautomorphism groups of free products and to group actions on manifolds which\nfiber over the circle."}

These constructions mirror the\nanalogous structures in the classical Zariski geometry of commutative rings\n(and commutative ring spectra), and we also demonstrate additional\ncompatibility between classical Zariski and higher Zariski geometry. For rigid\n2-rings, we show that the descent results of Balmer and Favi admit coherent\nenhancements.
