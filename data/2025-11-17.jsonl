However, despite these advances, skein modules of higher degree-those depending on more parameters than the linear and quadratic cases-have received comparatively little attention, with only a few isolated explorations appearing in the literature. In this article, we undertake a systematic study of the cubic skein module, the first representative of this broader class. We begin by investigating its structure and properties in the $3$-sphere, and then extend the analysis to arbitrary $3$-manifolds. The results presented here aim to establish a foundational framework for the study of higher skein modules, thereby extending the scope of skein theory beyond its classical domains. Furthermore, studying the structure of cubic skein modules may lead to new polynomial invariants of knots."}

The phenomenon was first observed for planar curves by Cook, Harbourne, Migliore and Nagel. This paper shows a syzygy-based construction of, possibly unexpected, hypersurfaces of degree $d+k$ in $\\mathbb{P}^n$, vanishing along a codimension two general linear subspace with multiplicity $d$; thus generalizing the work of Trok and the previous work of the last two authors. Our framework unifies the classical planar cases with higher-dimensional examples, including Trok's construction. We give a sufficient criterion for unexpectedness (via the splitting behaviour the syzygy bundles of the powers of the Jacobian ideal, associated with the hyperplane arrangement dual to $Z$) and provide explicit examples in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ and $\\mathbb{P}^4$."}

This yields a negative answer to a question of Esnault--Kisin--Petrov concerning the injectivity of the de Rham-to-crystalline comparison map for smooth affine schemes over the Witt vectors that admit good compactifications. In contrast, we establish injectivity for certain subspaces defined by slope conditions as well as in cohomological degree one. For the latter case, we also prove the result with coefficients in $F$-able overholonomic $D$-modules leveraging a generalisation of Kedlaya's full faithfulness theorem. Beyond injectivity, we obtain various separation results for the affinoid topology on rigid and convergent cohomology. These results allow us to determine integral algebraic de Rham cohomology modulo torsion and to provide a more conceptual explanation for Ertl and Shiho's construction of varieties for which integral Monsky--Washnitzer cohomology modulo torsion is not finitely generated. Along the way, we prove a new integral comparison theorem between Monsky--Washnitzer cohomology and algebraic de Rham cohomology and we define fractional $p$-adic Tate twists, computing non-integral slopes of crystalline cohomology."}

Extending earlier work on binary games, we analyze the structure of the associated Spohn CI varieties for generic games of arbitrary format. We show that for generic games the Spohn CI variety is either empty or has codimension equal to the sum of the players' strategy dimensions minus the number of players in the parametrized undirected graphical model. When non-empty, the set of totally mixed CI equilibria forms a smooth manifold for generic games. For cluster graphical models, we introduce the class of Nash CI varieties, prove their irreducibility, and describe their defining equations, degrees, and conditions for the existence of totally mixed CI equilibria for generic games."}
