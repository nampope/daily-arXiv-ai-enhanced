We show that for each integer $n$, there exists an algebraically doubly slice and ribbon knot $K$ whose $X$-double slice genus is greater than $n$. Our arguments use new $L^2$-signature obstructions to embedding closed 3-manifolds with infinite cyclic first homology into closed 4-manifolds with infinite cyclic fundamental group, in a way that preserves first homology. We also extend the concept of the superslice genus of a knot to simply connected 4-manifolds and show that there exist doubly slice knots whose generalized superslice genera are arbitrarily large. Furthermore, we define the double stabilizing number of a knot, extending the stabilizing number introduced by Conway and Nagel, and show that this invariant can also be arbitrarily large."}

We also investigate properties preserved under limits with respect to this distance, as well as properties of the entire class of metric spaces equipped with this distance. For this purpose, we introduce the notion of quasi-isometric distortion for correspondences. Using this notion, we prove that the class of all metric spaces is path-connected; in fact, any two metric spaces can be connected by a curve of finite length."}
