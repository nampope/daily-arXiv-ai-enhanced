We show that the injectivity and inversion properties of the\nstar transform are connected to its dual differential operator, an object\nintroduced in this paper. We prove that if the set of branch vectors forms a\nsymmetric shape with respect to the action of a finite rotation group $G$, then\nthe symbol of its dual differential operator belongs to the ring of\n$G$-invariant polynomials. Furthermore, we show that star transforms with\ndegenerate symmetry correspond to linear subspaces contained in the zero set of\ncertain elementary symmetric polynomials, and we investigate the associated\nreal algebraic Fano varieties. In particular, non-invertible star transforms in\ndimension 2 correspond to certain real lines on the Cayley nodal cubic surface."}

Furthermore, we show that even-dimensional ball\nquotients, associated with arithmetic subgroups of $\\operatorname{U}(1,n)$\ndefined over $E$, are always of general type if $n > 207$, or $n>12$ and\n$D>2557$. To establish these results, we construct a nontrivial full-level cusp\nform of weight $n$ on the $n$-dimensional complex ball. A key ingredient in our\nproof is the use of Arthur's multiplicity formula from the theory of\nautomorphic representations."}

This is stronger than the vanishing properties of the classical\nde Rham-Witt complex, crystalline cohomology, or de Rham cohomology, and is\ninstead comparable to \\'etale cohomology."}

In the present note, we complement the result by proving that the\nTate-Shafarevich group of a polarised K3 surface (S,h) with h primitive\nparametrises bijectively all torsors for the Jacobian of the generic curve in\nthe linear system |h| that admit a good hyperk\\\"ahler compactification. The\nresult is seen as the analogue of the classical fact that the Tate-Shafarevich\ngroup of an elliptic K3 surface is the subgroup of the Weil-Ch\\^atelet group of\nall twists that can be compactified to a K3 surface."}
