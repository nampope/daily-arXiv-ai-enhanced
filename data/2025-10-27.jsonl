The existence of a formal semi-universal deformation was proved\nbefore already by Schlessinger. To prove convergence Grauert had to solve a\nsystem of analytic equations, where a \"nested\" formal solution needed to be\napproximated by a nested analytic one. Grauert invented such an approximation\ntheorem under special assumptions, which is now called Grauert's approximation\ntheorem. In order to prove the theorem, Grauert introduced standard bases for\nideals in power series rings and proved a generalized Weiertra{\\ss} division\ntheorem. All this was done for convergent power series over the complex\nnumbers.\n  The purpose of this article is to extend Grauert's division and approximation\ntheorem to convergent power series over arbitrary real valued fields of any\ncharacteristic. As an application we deduce the existence of a convergent\nsemi-universal deformation for an isolated singularity and a splitting lemma\nfor not necessarily isolated hypersurface singularities over any real valued\nfield."}

The\napproach is motivated by Howald's description of the multiplier ideals of\nmonomial ideals. We show that the multiplier ideals of $D$ can be expressed in\nterms of a finite sequence of Newton polyhedra associated with the total\ntransform of $D$ in the toroidal resolution process. We prove that the\nmultiplier ideals are generalized monomial ideals with respect to a complete\nsequence of semi-roots. This is a finite sequence of functions which determines\na system of generators of the semigroup of the quasi-ordinary hypersurface. We\nexpress these results in terms of the local tropicalization associated with the\nembedding of $\\mathbb{C}^{d+1}$ defined by this sequence. We prove that the\nlocal tropicalization is the support of a fan of the lattice\n$\\mathbb{Z}^{d+g+1}$, which is determined by the embedded topological type of\n$(D, 0) \\subset (\\mathbb{C}^{d+1}, 0)$."}

In the\nprocess, given a relative derived Deligne-Mumford stack $Z$ over a derived\nstack $X$, we will first show that the $\\infty$-category of derived foliations\nover $Z$ relative to $X$ embeds as a full subcategory of derived stacks over\n$Z$ equipped with extra structure, and describe its essential image explicitly.\nWe will then show that given a proper schematic, flat, and local complete\nintersection map of derived stacks $f : X \\to Y$, the push-forward functor\n$f_*$ from derived stacks over $X$ to derived stacks over $Y$ preserves the\npreceding essential images, and thus defines a push-forward, from derived\nfoliations over $Z$ relative to $X$, to derived foliations over $f_* Z$\nrelative to $Y$. The aforementioned result on derived mapping stacks is\nobtained as a special case of this statement.
