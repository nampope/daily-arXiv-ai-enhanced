We further extend this result to the\nsemiampleness of the adjoint canonical line bundles. Using these, we prove the\ndeformation invariance of any generalized plurigenera by assuming that only one\nfiber admits the semiample canonical line bundle and improve the first\nauthor--Xiao-Lei Liu's recent deformation rigidity of projective manifolds with\nsemiample canonical line bundles. In particular, also by E. Viehweg--K. Zuo's\nresult on the minimal number of singular fibers in a family and the first\nauthor--X. Liu's isotriviality result, if a projective family over\n$\\mathbb{P}^1$ or an elliptic curve has one fiber with the big and nef (or more\ngenerally semiample) canonical line bundle, then all fibers are isomorphic to\nthis fiber.\n  Next, much inspired by M. Andreatta--T. Peternell's deformation theoretical\napproach, we prove that, in a smooth K\\\"ahler family of threefolds, if the\ncanonical line bundle of one fiber is not nef, then none of its small\ndeformations admits a nef canonical line bundle either.
