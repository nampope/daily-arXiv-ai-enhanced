We show that the degeneracy of the small vertical quantum\nspectrum of a Grassmann bundle - namely, the appearance of eigenvalues with\nunexpectedly high multiplicities - is controlled by the prime factorization of\nthe involved ranks. This extends earlier results for Grassmannians to the\nrelative setting and applies, in particular, to partial flag varieties viewed\nas total spaces of Grassmann bundles.\n  We then introduce three families of double sequences that classify partial\nflag varieties according to distinct quantum spectral and combinatorial\nfeatures. Their recursive and arithmetic behavior is studied through ordinary\nand Dirichlet generating functions. One of these sequences satisfies a\nPascal-type recursion, allowing a precise analysis of its partial Dirichlet\nseries, whose analytic continuation exhibits logarithmic singularities\ndetermined by the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Moreover, for\nany fixed integer shift, the diagonal subsequences display eventual polynomial\nbehavior, which admits a natural interpretation in terms of weighted walks on\ngraphs. Finally, we examine the vanishing pattern of one of these sequences and\nderive equivalent formulations of Goldbach's conjecture.\n  Overall, the paper reveals a rich correspondence between enumerative\ngeometry, quantum spectral degeneracy, and classical problems in prime number\ntheory."}
