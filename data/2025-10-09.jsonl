Given a\nHeegaard diagram of an irreducible $3$-manifold $M$, we associate a Heegaard\ngraph $G\\subset S$ on the Heegaard surface and restrict to those arising from\nminimal-genus splittings with a minimal number of vertices. We prove that, up\nto the natural equivalence of embedded graphs, only finitely many of such\nminimal Heegaard graphs occur for a fixed manifold. This finiteness enables the\ndefinition of $3$-manifold polynomials by evaluating embedded-graph polynomials\non representatives of these classes.\n  For lens spaces we show that the associated Heegaard graphs can be fully\nclassified, and that this classification coincides with the classical one for\n$L(p,q)$. In this setting the Tutte, Penrose, and Bollob\\'as-Riordan\npolynomials behave as invariants of lens spaces, and computational evidence\nsuggests that they may in fact be complete invariants. For the Poincar\\'e\nhomology sphere we find that distinct minimal Heegaard diagrams yield\ncoinciding ribbon-graph polynomials, opening the way to interesting conjectures\nabout their discriminating power and the possibility of completeness for\nbroader families of $3$-manifolds."}
