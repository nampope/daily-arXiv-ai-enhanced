If the fundamental\ngroup of $X$ lies in a certain class, which includes trivial, free, and finite\ngroups of odd order, we show the answer is always affirmative. On the other\nhand, we produce the first examples of manifolds $X$ and diffeomorphisms $f$\nwhere the answer is negative. Our investigation is motivated by the question,\nwhich remains open, of whether there exists a self-diffeomorphism of a closed\n4-manifold that is topologically isotopic to the identity, but not stably\nsmoothly isotopic to the identity."}

In addition, the paper specializes this study to the\ncase of $(p,q)$-curves, where we obtain more structured results for the motivic\nclasses of fixed-generators Hilbert schemes: their positivity and topological\ninvariance, and an explicit relationship to one-generator schemes i.e.\nprincipal ideals in $\\widehat{\\mathcal{O}}_{C,0}$. Finally, we focus on a\nspecial open component in the one-generator locus, whose motivic class is\nnaturally related to the motivic measure on the arc scheme $\\mathbb A^2_\\infty$\nof the plane introduced by Denef and Loeser as well as to the Igusa zeta\nfunction.
