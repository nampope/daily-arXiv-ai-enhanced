Our main result refines this theorem, providing a more explicit geometric interpretation of the homotopy groups of unstable Thom spectra. Building on this result, we show that previously unknown cobordism groups can be expressed as homotopy groups of unstable Thom spectra. Furthermore, using the Smith homomorphism, we compute these groups. As applications, we determine the values of $n$ for which there exists a Spin manifold with boundary $S^n$ admitting a line subbundle orthogonal to the boundary, and provide a precise characterization of the cobordism group introduced by Bais, May Custodio, and Torres."}

We then use algebraic K-theory to construct a space $\\mathbf{Q}(X)$ of quantum cellular automata (QCA) on a given metric space $X$. In most cases of interest, $π_0 \\mathbf{Q}(X)$ classifies QCA up to quantum circuits and stabilization. Notably, the QCA spaces are related by homotopy equivalences $\\mathbf{Q}(*) \\simeq Ω^n \\mathbf{Q}(\\mathbb{Z}^n)$ for all $n$, which shows that the classification of QCA on Euclidean lattices is given by an $Ω$-spectrum indexed by the dimension $n$. As a corollary, we also obtain a non-connective delooping of the K-theory of Azumaya $R$-algebras, which may be of independent interests. We also include a section leading to the $Ω$-spectrum for QCA over $C^*$-algebras with unitary circuits."}
