The paper is split into two parts. In the first part, we find infinitely many overtwisted, right-veering monodromies on the four-punctured sphere. This is done using the techniques developed by Ito-Kawamuro in the papers arXiv:1112.5874, arXiv:1310.6404. Although most of the monodromies that we show are overtwisted are pseudo-Anosov, we are also able to classify precisely which reducible monodromies on the four-punctured sphere are tight. In the second part of the paper, we reprove part of a result of Lekili arXiv:1008.3529 by classifying which reducible mondromies have non-zero Heegaard Floer invariant. This is done by using the bordered contact invariants of Min-Varvarezos arXiv:2410.05511."}

Starting from a reduced link diagram, we construct three-page presentations via binding circles arising as boundaries of suitable contractible subcomplexes of the induced cell decomposition of the $2$-sphere. This approach allows a refined control of the number of arcs in the resulting three-page presentation.\n  As a consequence, we prove that for any non-split, nontrivial link $L$ other than the Hopf link, \\[ α_3(L)\\le 3c(L)-1, \\] and hence characterize completely the links for which $α_3(L)=3c(L)$."}

We construct a class $Ψ$ of fiber-preserving, orientation-reversing involutions that act trivially on the base. Each element of $Ψ$ is obtained by extending a product involution across Seifert pieces of type $V(2,2;-1)$ - a solid torus with three fibers filled according to Seifert invariants $(2,1)$, $(2,1)$, and $(1,-1)$. We show that $Ψ$ forms a single conjugacy class under fiber-preserving diffeomorphisms. Our main result establishes that any fiber-preserving, orientation-reversing involution factors as $ψ\\circ g$, where $g$ is fiber-preserving and orientation-preserving and $ψ\\inΨ$, thus reducing the problem to the previously known orientation-preserving case. Through the orientable base-space double covering, we further extend the classification to manifolds with non-orientable base orbifold."}

One is the property of being finitely generated as a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-algebra, and the other is the existence of indecomposable elements. This paper definitively resolves both problems for the fully effective case. Specifically, let $\\mathcal{Z}_*((\\mathbb{Z}_2)^k)$ denote the equivariant bordism ring of smooth closed manifolds equipped with fully effective smooth $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^k$-actions having only isolated fixed points. We prove that $\\mathcal{Z}_*((\\mathbb{Z}_2)^k)$ is not finitely generated as a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-algebra for all $k\\geqslant 3$.

This complements previous work from Henke, Libmand and Lynd. We further use the developed technique to study the Benson-Solomon fusion systems thus relating higher limits over the centric fusion orbit category of these systems with the signalizer functors described by Aschbacher and Chermak.

These results give a better picture on how Chebyshev sets, ball intersections, ball hulls, and completions of bounded sets are related to each other. It is shown that the Chebyshev set of a bounded set $K$ always contains the Chebyshev set of some completion of $K$. Moreover, for a special class of sets we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition that the Chebyshev set of the respective set is a singleton. We obtain new results on critical sets of Chebyshev centers, and for that purpose, surprisingly, notions from the combinatorial geometry of convex bodies play an essential role. Also we give a complete geometric description of the ball hull of a finite planar set. This can be taken as starting point for algorithmical constructions of the ball hull of such sets."}

Second, we conclude that the group of homotopy classes of simple self-equivalences of a connected nilpotent space that act as the identity on the fundamental group is commensurable to an arithmetic group, building on a theorem of Sullivan.
