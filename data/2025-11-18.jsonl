For every nontrivial element $x\\in π_1(Σ_g)$, we obtain a uniform representation of the normal forms of $x^k$ under the length-lexicographical order. Based on this, we find a new relation among these normal forms, and then derive the following three formulae related to the word length: $|x^2|>|x|$; $|x^k|=(k-1)(|x^2|-|x|)+|x|$; $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\frac{|x^k|}{k}=|x^2|-|x|$. Moreover, we extend these results to obtain analogous but less precise formulae for every minimal geometric presentation. Finally, we define the normal forms of conjugacy classes in $π_1(Σ_g)$ and give a criterion for determining the conjugacy of elements. As a consequence, we give efficient algorithms for solving the root-finding and conjugacy problems."}
