This gives a multi-twist paper M\\\"obius band. We\nprove that any multi-twist paper M\\\"obius band can be constructed so the aspect\nratio of the rectangle is $3\\sqrt{3}+\\epsilon$ for any $\\epsilon>0$. We could\nalso take the thin, rectangular strip of paper and tie a knot in it, then join\nthe ends and fold flat in the plane. This creates a folded ribbon knot. We\napply the techniques used to prove the multi-twist paper M\\\"obius band result\nto $(2,q)$ torus knots and twist knots. We prove that any $(2,q)$-torus knot\ncan be constructed so that the folded ribbonlength $\\leq 13.86$. We prove that\nany twist knot can be constructed so that the folded ribbonlength is $\\leq\n17.59$. Both of these results give the lower bound for the ribbonlength\ncrossing number problem which relates the infimal folded ribbonlength of a knot\ntype $[K]$ to its crossing number $\\text{Cr}(K)$. That is, we have shown\n$\\alpha=0$ in the equation $c\\cdot \\text{Cr}(K)^\\alpha \\leq \\text{Rib}([K])$,\nwhere $c$ is a constant."}
