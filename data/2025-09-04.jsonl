We find that the usual\nbalancing condition fails when the bundle is non-trivial and that the failure\nis captured by the first Chern classes of the line bundles associated to $X$.\nWe discuss a geometric perspective of tropicalization where the weights arise\nnaturally from intersection theory. The relations between divisors on a toric\nvariety bundle put constraints on these weights which leads to the balancing\ncondition."}

We call them Baker functions.\nThe construction is based on the Abel-Jacobi map, which allows us to identify\nthe field of meromorphic functions on the Jacobian variety of the curve with\nthe field of meromorphic functions on the symmetric product of the curve. In\nour previous paper, a solution to the KP equation was constructed in terms of\nthe Baker function. This paper is devoted to the properties of the Baker\nfunctions. In this paper, we construct an entire function whose second\nlogarithmic derivatives are the Baker functions. We prove that the power series\nexpansion of the entire function around the origin is determined only by the\ncoefficients of the defining equation of the curve and a branch point of the\ncurve algebraically. We also describe the quasi-periodicity of the entire\nfunction and express the entire function in terms of the Riemann theta\nfunction."}
