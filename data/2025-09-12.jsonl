We show that the\ntwo maps are compatible in a precise sense, and that the compatibility map is\nnatural under changes of triangulation; for surfaces, this resolves a\nconjecture of Neitzke and Yan. As a corollary, under a mild hypothesis on the\n3-manifold, the quantum trace map can be recovered from the quantum UV-IR map,\nhence providing yet another construction of the recently introduced 3d quantum\ntrace map."}

We show strongly quasipositive surfaces are\nright-veering, thereby generalizing the corresponding result for open books and\nproviding a proof that does not draw on contact geometry. In fact, we\ncharacterize when all elements of a family of incompressible surfaces that is\nclosed under positive stabilization are right-veering.
