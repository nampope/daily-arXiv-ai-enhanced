We introduce the notion of $τ$- and $ρ$-tangles and good rectangles and annuli. By classifying $τ$- and $ρ$-tangles whose exteriors admit a good rectangle or annulus, we categorize atoroidal $3$-decomposable genus two handlebody-knots into distinct classes, based on the number of essential annuli. As an application, the hyperbolicity of all genus two handlebody-knots with up to six crossings are determined, and numerous hyperbolic handlehody-knots with seven crossings identified. Furthermore, obstructions for a handlebody-knot to be $3$-decomposable are constructed with explicit examples provided."}

The genus $g$, the number of boundary components $b$, and the boundary slope $p/q$ are fundamental invariants of an essential surface. The \\textit{realization problem} asks whether, for a given triple $(g, b, q)$ with $g \\ge 0$, $b \\ge 1$, and $q \\ge 1$, there exists a knot $K \\subset S^3$ whose exterior $E(K)$ contains a compact orientable essential surface $F$ of genus $g$ with $b$ boundary components and boundary slope $p/q$ for some $p$.\n  In general, not all combinations of $(g, b, q)$ are realizable. First, we show that if $b$ is odd, then $q$ must be equal to $1$. Our main theorem states that for any given even $b \\ge 2$ and $q \\ge 1$, there exist a genus $g \\ge 0$ and a knot $K$ such that $E(K)$ contains a compact orientable essential surface with these parameters."}

We then prove that our construction is compatible with the previous ones under Rasmussen's spectral sequence from HOMFLY--PT homology to Khovanov homology. Our construction is elementary and well suited to diagrammatic manipulations and algorithmic implementations. As a result, we verify directly that these additional structures distinguish pairs of knots with identical Khovanov homology and HOMFLY--PT homology, in particular the Conway knot and the Kinoshita--Terasaka knot."}

These families generalize the classical Dehn quandle and are defined, respectively, on isotopy classes of unoriented closed curves and on integral weighted multicurves. We establish their fundamental algebraic properties and construct a natural quandle covering that relates them. We then analyze their metric properties, showing that these quandles are unbounded with respect to the quandle metric. Next, we compute their second bounded quandle cohomology, proving it to be infinite-dimensional. We also establish a version of the Gromov Mapping Theorem, showing that the natural map from an abelian quandle extension onto the original quandle induces an injection on bounded quandle cohomology in every dimension. Finally, inspired by recent developments in quandle rings, we analyze idempotents in the integral quandle rings arising from the classical Dehn quandle of a surface."}

The latest version is maintained at https://kurlin.org/projects/cloud-isometry-spaces/strength-simplex.pdf", "summary": "The basic input for many real shapes is a finite cloud of unordered points. The strongest equivalence between shapes in practice is Euclidean motion. The recent polynomial-time classification of point clouds required a Lipschitz continuous function that vanishes on degenerate simplices, while the usual volume is not Lipschitz. We define the strength of any geometric simplex and prove its continuity under perturbations with explicit bounds for Lipschitz constants."}
